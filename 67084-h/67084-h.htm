  <p>As there has been so much said and written about the American Indians,
    with my tribe, the Klamath Indians, included, by the white people,
    which is guessed at and not facts, I deem it necessary to first tell
    you who I am, for which please do not criticise me as egotistical.</p>

  <p>I am a pure full blooded Klamath river woman. In our tongue we call
    this great river by the name of Health-kick-wer-roy, and I wear the
    Tat-toos on my chin that has been the custom for our women for many
    generations. I was born at Pec-wan village, and of highest birth
    or what we term under the highest laws of marriage. I am known by
    my people as a Talth. My maiden name was Che-na-wah Weitch-ah-wah,
    Che-na-wah being my given name. My father, being also a Talth, took me
    at a very early age and began training me in all of the mysteries and
    laws of my people. It took me years to learn and the ordeal was a hard
    one. I was made a Talth and given the true name of God, the Creator
    of all things, and taught the meaning of every article that is used
    in our festivals, together with all the laws governing our people. I
    can understand every word, every nod and gesture made in our language.
    Therefore I feel that I am in a better position than any other person
    to tell the true facts of the religion and the meaning of the many
    things that we used to commemorate the events of the past. In this book
    I will endeavor to tell all in a plain and truthful way without the
    least coloring of the facts, and will add many of our fairy tales and
    mother’s stories to their children. I will also give the names of many
    things in my own native tongue.</p>

  <div class="subhead">BILL McGARVEY’S STORE.</div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE Old Klamath Bluffs Store, or fort, and in late years the Klamath
    Post Office, was built in 1855 or 1856, by a man named Snider. He
    conducted it as a trading post for Indians, soldiers and travelers
    alike. It was built of rough split lumber and strongly made of double
    walls with sawed blocks four inches thick placed between the walls, and
    was bullet proof, with port-holes so that a few white men could defend
    themselves against many Indians. This store is located twenty-four
    miles up the river from its mouth, and is about eighteen miles down
    the river from Weitchpec or the junction of the Trinity River, and
    something like forty miles below Orleans Bar on the Klamath. Orleans
    Bar was at one time the County Seat of Klamath County. The old store
    is on the north bank of the river on a bar that was formed in ancient
    times, and is high enough to make it safe from all high waters. It is a
    beautiful, sunny spot and on the line of travel up and down the Klamath
    river.</p>

  <p>The north side of the river is mostly prairie along the bank, and the
    old Indian trail is on that side. The whites took up the Indian trails
    and improved them so they were traveled by all. This old store is also
    the central ground for the lower Klamath Indians, as here close by is
    where they held the sacred White Deer-Skin Dance, which is a worship
    to their God. Here for ages past have gathered the wealthiest and
    most prominent Indians, both men and women of all the upper and lower
    Klamath tribe, including the Hoopa, Smith River and our Indians down
    the coast as far as Trinidad.</p>

  <p>White men have visited this famous old store, whose names will go
    down in history, such as General Crook and many other army officers,
    besides many wealthy business men. All of them liked to linger in
    this beautiful spot where the sun shines warm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span> and the pleasant sea
    breeze fans it all through the summer months. There is a trail to
    this place from the north, Crescent City, Reck-woy and other places.
    This is not a mining country as there are no mines below the mouth of
    the Trinity, except in the river gravel or in the low bars that have
    been washed down from the upper Klamath and Trinity rivers where all
    the rich gold-bearing mining placers are found. These mines were the
    cause of the old store being a central stopping place for the men in
    the early days, going to and from the mines. In the Fall of 1876 I
    counted upwards of three thousand Indians there at a White Deer-Skin
    dance. There were five different languages spoken among them, the lower
    Klamath, upper Klamath, Hoopa, Smith River and Mad River. Some of them
    could speak two and some three, while others could only speak one. So
    it can be seen that this old Klamath Bluff store or Klamath Post office
    as it is now called, has been the scene of many and not a few murders
    and this store will be mentioned often in my writing.</p>

  <p>In about the year 1861 Snider sold the stock of goods to Bill McGarvey,
    a jolly Irishman. It was Bill McGarvey that named me Lucy, yet he
    always called me by my Indian name, Che-na-wah. Bill McGarvey kept in
    stock plenty of whiskey, always in the flat pint bottles, which he sold
    at a dollar a bottle to the whites and Indians alike. He would only
    bring out one bottle at a time in selling it to the Indians so that any
    time they became quarrelsome he could tell them that it was all gone.
    Bill McGarvey had many ups and downs in the way of his trading there
    among them and I will tell of some of his experiences.</p>

  <p>Three Indians came to the store one day bringing with them a fine
    looking young Indian girl and wanted to borrow thirty dollars and
    leave the girl as security. He talked it over for awhile, the Indians
    saying that they had to have this amount to make a settlement with some
    other Indians, that they would come back and pay him and take the girl
    in thirty days. So he decided to let them have the money without due
    consideration of how he would take care of the girl. After they were
    gone he began to think of the situation that he had placed himself
    in, as he was a bachelor. So he made up a room for her and when it
    came to cooking he thought he would have her wash the dishes and sweep
    the house but she would do no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span> house work unless he paid her for it.
    McGarvey tried to argue the case with her and told her that he had to
    furnish her food and cook it, also furnish a room and a bed to sleep
    in and that she ought to clean up the house. She answered by telling
    him that he was doing only what he had to do and that she would not
    work unless he paid her for it. McGarvey had to absolutely wait on her
    for the whole thirty days as completely as if she had owned him as a
    slave. She could go and come as she liked, always coming back in time
    so he could not make a complaint, telling him that if he said so, she
    would stay in the house all the time. He said that the experience was
    in after years a lesson to him in dealing with the Indians. When the
    thirty days were up they came with the money, paid him and took the
    girl.</p>

  <p>Another time he wanted to get in his winter supplies and at that time
    he got his goods from Crescent City, (Caw-paw) and he went to Cortep
    village which is about six hundred yards above the store and on the
    same side of the river to see if he could hire them to go down the
    Klamath and out to sea to Crescent City with their canoes, as they
    had a large new one. He hired five of them, all Cortep Indians to go
    and bring his goods into the mouth of the river and store them there
    until they had them all in before the ocean would get too rough, as the
    winter months were coming on.</p>

  <p>Early in the morning the five Indians of the Cortep village (this was
    a town village of the Klamath tribe) started down the river and on
    arriving at the mouth never stopped to take a view of the weather, but
    put out to sea. The ocean was very rough, the waves were rolling high,
    and when they got into the breakers their boat capsized and all five of
    them were drowned. This brought on serious trouble for Bill McGarvey.
    The relatives of the drowned Indians talked it over for three or four
    months and then decided to go to McGarvey and demand pay, the most of
    it to be paid in Indian money. McGarvey said that after counting it
    up it would amount in our gold to about fifteen hundred dollars. He
    refused to pay it, telling them that he was not responsible for the
    drowning, that he had only hired them to bring in his goods by water,
    that their getting drowned was not his fault and he would not pay. At
    this they went away.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span></p>

  <p>Two or three days after, late in the evening he heard small stones
    striking on the shed-roof of the kitchen at the back part of the
    store. He listened, but heard no more, so he went to the door of the
    kitchen, enclosed with a high, strong picket fence, and opposite the
    kitchen door was a gate in this fence, and as he looked out of the door
    there stood a tall, slender fine looking Indian woman, one that had
    always been a friend of McGarvey, and not only to him but to all the
    whites. This woman was my close kindred which gave me the opportunity
    of knowing it correctly. She beckoned to McGarvey to come, and as
    he came up to her she told him to make preparations for himself and
    the other two men that were in the store to defend themselves as the
    Cortep Indians would be there very early the next morning and would
    kill him unless they could manage to hold the Indians off. Then the
    Indian woman stealthily crept away and back to her home while McGarvey
    and his two friends, Jack Paupaw and George A. White, began at once to
    prepare for their defence as well as they could. They got in as good a
    supply of water as they had vessels to hold it in, closed the doors and
    bolted them from the inside and opened the port-holes. Under the store
    was a large cellar just on a level with the ground from the outside.
    Sure enough, early the next morning there came twenty-five or thirty
    of them, with their faces blackened with war paint and yelling the
    war-hoop. But McGarvey and his friends were ready to keep them at bay
    for a few hours, until a young Indian that was a great friend of the
    whites and a life-long friend to McGarvey came and as he walked up to
    the door of the store he asked to be let in. They opened the door and
    let him in. This Indian, named So-pin-itts (Solomon), lived close by
    and is yet living. After he was in the store awhile he went out and
    talked it over with the Indians and called a stop till the next day,
    during which time McGarvey tried to make a settlement with them; and
    finally by telling them that it was too much money, that he never kept
    so much money in the store and that the only way he could pay that
    amount was to send to Crescent City and get his friends there to help
    him. Finally the Indians, consented to this and all of them went home.
    McGarvey wrote a letter to his friends in Crescent City asking them to
    help him, telling them of the situation he was in and asked them to
    intercede in his behalf or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span> the three of them would be killed by the
    Indians. He also wrote a letter to the Government officer in command
    of the Smith River Indian Reservation, telling him of his predicament
    and asking him to send a squad of soldiers to his assistance, and then
    dispatched the letters by an Indian in post haste. The Indian, not
    knowing the contents of the letters, went with all speed to deliver them
    to the friend of McGarvey at Crescent City. The friend, after reading
    them, also made haste to deliver the one to the commanding officer,
    while the officer in turn arranged to send ten soldiers with an officer
    to the McGarvey store. They arrived at the store on the morning of the
    fifth day after the truce had been given. At daylight the soldiers came
    down the hill to the north of the store, whooping and yelling at the
    top of their voices, after a long and tedious march of almost day and
    night over rough mountain trails, up hill and down, through brush and
    timber with only part of the distance in the open ground, traveling for
    about fifty hours.</p>

  <p>On the arrival of the soldiers the Indians were dismayed, knowing
    that they had been out-generaled and that McGarvey had sent for the
    soldiers instead of sending for the money to pay them, and had done it
    by sending one of their own men to deliver the message. At this turn of
    affairs the Indians quieted down and abided their time, as they never
    get in a hurry to make a settlement.</p>

  <p>After the soldiers had been there for a few days they received orders
    to remain until further notice. It was then that McGarvey hired some
    men to build an addition to the store. This was erected at the west
    end of the store, about twelve feet wide and eighteen feet long and
    eight feet high to the eaves. It stood out over a steep bank of a small
    creek that comes down close to the west end of the store. This made
    comfortable quarters for the soldiers where they would be sheltered
    from the hot rays of the summer heat and the rains of the winter
    months, also privacy from the prying eyes of the inquisitive Indians.
    Here the soldiers remained for about eight months, having all sorts
    of a jolly time, as Bill McGarvey had plenty of whiskey to supply
    their thirst at a dollar a bottle after each pay day. McGarvey on some
    occasions would take quite freely of the whiskey himself, becoming
    intoxicated and boisterous. On these occasions his friend Solomon, the
    Indian,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span> would go into the store and keep him straight, locking the
    doors and letting no one in.</p>

  <p>Jack Paupaw and George White went to their own homes. Jack Paupaw was
    a blacksmith by trade and was working in Crescent City. He was an old
    pioneer of Crescent City and the Klamath river. He returned to Crescent
    City while White went up the river to a place known as Big Bar, thus
    leaving McGarvey with the soldiers, as everything was now quiet. Things
    proceeded smoothly while the soldiers were there and all thought that
    the trouble was forgiven and forgotten and the soldiers were ordered
    back to their command.</p>

  <p>But the Indians of the Cortep village began to scheme for another plan
    for revenge of their lost relatives, but gave up McGarvey and chose
    this time a man by the name of Bryson who was the superintendent of the
    Klamath Bluffs Mine, situated only about two hundred yards up the river
    from the store. Bryson had a miner’s cabin which he lived in while
    working at the mines, up from the river out of the way of high water.
    The mine was down close to the river. He was coming up the trail to
    his cabin for dinner just about twelve o’clock when one of the Cortep
    Indians shot him down in his tracks with one of the old muzzle loading
    rifles; this Indian was named Lotch-kum. Then all the Indians left for
    the timber to get out of the way of the whites and friendly Indians.
    This started the row going again and McGarvey barricaded his store
    until the friendly Indians came to his assistance. The first family to
    come was Weitch-ah-wah (my father) and his brother (my uncle).</p>

  <p>At that time they were camped at the mouth of Tec-tah creek, some four
    miles down the river from the store, and as soon as they heard of the
    killing of Bryson they started for their home at the Pec-wan village
    about one mile above the store and on going home went by the store
    and stopped to learn the particulars of the killing. McGarvey made
    arrangements with Warrots (my uncle) to go up the river and give notice
    to the whites, T. M. Brown, the Sheriff of Klamath County, and to the
    soldiers stationed at Camp Gaston in Hoopa Valley, some twelve miles up
    the Trinity river from its junction with the Klamath. After Warrots had
    delivered the message at all points he stealthily returned to his home
    at Pec-wan in the night so the other Indians would not find out he was
    on this errand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span> against them. On the day following Warrots’s return,
    the Sheriff and other white men came among them. George A. White, who
    was a cripple as has before been stated, started to walk on the front
    porch of the store when some of the angry Indians said to him, Melasses
    White you can’t fight, you are crippled (Melasses was his Indian name).</p>

  <p>White went back into the store and got one of the first makes of Henry
    rifles. (The one Warrots had let McGarvey have to defend himself
    with, and was the one my brother had brought from Oregon while he was
    up there with the white men and was the only one to be found on the
    Klamath of the kind and make at that time). As soon as the Cortep
    Indians saw the rifle they knew at once that Warrots had given it to
    the whites to shoot them with and it caused them to swear vengeance
    against Warrots and his brother. Upon further inquiry they also
    found out that Warrots had been up to Hoopa and told of the killing
    of Bryson. T. M. Brown having been the Sheriff of Klamath County a
    number of years and also a pioneer of the Klamath river was quite well
    acquainted with the habits and customs of the Klamath river Indians and
    he counseled with the friendly Indians and agreed to pay them for their
    services if they would bring in the guilty Indian Lotch-kum dead or
    alive. So Warrots set out to find Lotch-kum and kept watching different
    places to find where he was hiding. The country being heavily timbered
    Lotch-kum kept out of sight for nearly a year but at last Warrots
    found where he was hiding in a creek some eight miles down the river
    from the store and about one mile up the creek from the river in the
    heavy redwood timber, in a large pile of drift logs. He first heard
    Lotch-kum’s little fist dog bark and on watching patiently for awhile
    saw Lotch-kum come out. At this he went back to his home in the Pec-wan
    village, then visited with the Ser-e-goin village and told them that he
    had found the hiding place of Lotch-kum. When they got ready three of
    them, the other two being from the Ser-e-goin village, Monmonth Jack
    and Marechus Charley, with Warrots leading the way arrived close to
    Lotch-kum’s hiding place. They commenced to keep a close lookout for
    him, as they could see his tracks in the soft dirt and sand in the bed
    of the creek; and had to keep up the watch for about ten days. Finally
    they saw him come creeping out to the creek where he began to bathe
    himself.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span> Warrots raised his rifle to his shoulder, took aim and fired,
    Charley and Jack firing next. Lotch-kum fell to the ground but kept
    raising up and falling down again, trying to get away, when the three
    of them ran up to him as fast as they could, drew their long heavy
    knives and severed his head, put it in a sack and carried it back to
    the old store in triumph. Inside they rolled it out on the counter,
    which satisfied the whites for the killing of Bryson. Bryson was
    buried in a pretty spot a little north-east of the store, with hardly
    a mark to show the place where he was to sleep, and all settled down
    to peace and quietness again between the Indians and the whites. But
    the Pec-wan Indians were divided between the Indians and the whites,
    some of them were friendly to the whites while others took sides with
    the Cortep Indians. Warrots was a Pec-wan Indian and full brother to
    Weitch-ah-wah. The Sheriff and Government officers gave to the three
    Indians who had killed Lotch-kum, letters of very high recommendations
    for their services and to the good graces of all the whites. (I have
    seen these letters with the signatures many times in my girl-hood days.)</p>

  <p>Now the Cortep village and part of the Pec-wan village began to make
    plans to kill Warrots, and as he was considered to be a good and
    faithful friend of the whites by these Indians, it must be done in a
    way so as to deceive the whites and not to let them know it was being
    done as a revenge for the part he had taken in killing Lotch-kum. So
    they bided their time waiting for a good chance, but all the time
    Warrots was hearing of their schemes through his friends and he went
    to the Sheriff and Government officers and told them that Lotch-kum’s
    friends were planning to kill him and all of them promised him that
    no one would be allowed to harm him. Sheriff Brown sent him word to
    meet him at Trinidad as Trinidad was at that time in Klamath County.
    Warrots came and laid the facts before him and the Sheriff promised
    him protection and Warrots went back home. After about three weeks his
    brother Weitch-ah-wah and all the family except myself (I was about
    eight years of age) went away, thereby Warrots’s enemies got their
    chance to carry out their plans. Early in the morning Warrots went
    down to the creek which was only a short distance, to bathe and there
    he met a little boy, the son of Pec-wan Ma-hatch-us. He spoke to the
    boy, bathed in the creek and went back up to the house,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span> when he saw
    another Indian coming up the river trail from the Cortep village,
    and as he passed the boy Warrots saw him stop, talk to the boy and
    give him a piece of bread which he ate. The boy then came up to the
    Pec-wan village while the Indian, who was from the Cortep village,
    kept on up the river. As the boy got to his house he became ill and
    in about thirty minutes died. Evidently the Indian had given him a
    piece of poisoned bread which had killed him. They gave no attention
    to the one that gave the bread but instead laid all the blame on
    Warrots for the death of the boy and as soon as the ceremony and
    burial was over they pounced upon Warrots and shot him at the door of
    his sweat-house, killing him. The next day Warrots was laid to rest
    in the grave-yard of his own folks in Pec-wan village. None of the
    whites ever made any attempt to punish any of the Indians or stop them
    from killing him. This is the reward he received for being a faithful
    friend to the whites in times of need. His brother with his family was
    forced to leave their home in Pec-wan village and move to Ser-e-goin
    village, where lived the friends and helpers of Warrots, Mermis Jack
    and Ser-e-goin Charley. After living there for awhile we moved up to
    Hoopa so as to get farther away from our enemies and where we could
    have a better chance for protection. I took a position with the Agent
    which they said I filled with credit to myself and satisfaction to
    them. Mermis Jack and Ser-e-goin Charley lived for many years but were
    never friendly with the friends of Lotch-kum. Mermis Jack finally died
    suddenly and in a manner that pointed strongly that he was given poison
    in his food. Ser-e-goin Charley died a natural death in 1886.</p>

  <p>In 1876 Bill McGarvey died in the old store that went by his name so
    long. He had not been feeling well for some time. In the large room at
    the west end of the store building he had a large stone fire-place, put
    in many years before and he used this room as his bed-room and also
    a sitting room. In this room he was taking his bath in a tub when he
    fell over dead in front of the fire-place. The same evening his Indian
    lady friend died in her home which was just a short distance from the
    store. McGarvey had outside shutters to his windows which fastened
    from the inside and these he had fastened, and in the morning as he
    did not open the store, his Indian friend Solomon waited until late in
    the morning for the opening of the store, when he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span> became suspicious
    of all not being right. He pried open the shutter of the window on
    the south side of the store which would give him a view of everything
    in the room where McGarvey slept, and there before the large stone
    fire-place lay McGarvey cold in death and beside him was the tub in
    which he was taking his bath. When the Indians heard of his death they
    all said Bill McGarvey and Mollie have both gone over to the other side
    together. (Mollie was closely related to all my folks.) Bill McGarvey
    was laid to rest by the side of Bryson, on the flat above the store,
    and the store passed into the hands of James McGarvey, a brother of
    Bill. James McGarvey made the claim that he was the only living brother
    which was afterwards said to be false, yet he got the store and ran
    it for several years. He kept whiskey and sold it to the Indians and
    the whites. The Indians would get drunk and have fights and kill each
    other until he finally got mixed up with them by having a row over one
    Indian finding a pistol in the trail that belonged to a white man by
    name of Jim Douglas. McGarvey thought he would make the Indian give up
    the pistol in short order and he went into the Wah-tec village which is
    situated but a short distance from the store and as he got within a few
    yards of Ray-no, the Indian, he drew his pistol and commenced to shoot
    at him. McGarvey’s shots went wild and the Indian drew his pistol and
    shot McGarvey, striking him in the back on the left side, just missing
    the back-bone and went clean through the body on the striffin of his
    stomach and he fell to the ground. The white men went to his assistance
    and carried him to the store and the Indians that were in the row
    left and went up the river to other villages with the pistol in their
    possession. This raised quite a furor of excitement and the whites were
    counseled with by the Indians that were friendly to both sides and they
    were asked to bring back the ones that were in the shooting of McGarvey
    and to bring back the pistol to the rightful owner. The next day they
    came back and returned the pistol to James Douglas and he gave them
    five dollars to be given to the one that found it. In some three weeks
    Jim McGarvey was up and walking around and in a short time went to
    Orleans Bar, where there was a Justice of the Peace and tried to swear
    out a warrant for the arrest of the Indian but the warrant was refused
    by the Justice who told him that he had commenced the row himself by
    shooting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span> first, while intoxicated. Several years before this, Klamath
    County was taken off the map by being absorbed into Humboldt and Del
    Norte Counties, leaving this old Klamath Bluffs store in Humboldt
    County.</p>

  <p>Jim McGarvey was selling whiskey to the Indians and causing so much
    trouble among them that it caused a number of killing scrapes. After
    this trouble was settled and Jim McGarvey got well of his wounds, he
    sold the store to Peter Kane and moved down the Klamath River to within
    about three miles of the mouth of the river and settled at the mouth
    of a small creek close to the bank of the river, taking with him all
    of his ill gotten gains and his beautiful little Indian woman that had
    lived with him for years and to whom he had never been married by any
    law. She was neat and tidy and a good cook but McGarvey got mad at her
    for crying over the death of her mother and struck her on the back of
    her head. From this she began to lose her mind and he finally abandoned
    her and she became a raving maniac and died, leaving no children. Her
    body was taken back up to her birthplace and laid to rest with her kin
    in the family grave-yard, while Jim McGarvey lived on his place for a
    few years and then died.</p>

  <p>Peter Kane now had the store and he also kept whiskey and a rough
    house. He would sell whiskey to the Indians and get drunk himself,
    having trouble all around. He said one fall that he had two five
    gallon kegs of whiskey and that the Indians close around there had
    four hundred dollars and that he would get it all out of them for the
    two kegs of whiskey. His selling to them was the cause of four of them
    getting killed. Peter Kane had an Indian woman belonging to Redwood
    creek. She spoke the Hoopa tongue and bore him three children. One day
    one of the little girls about seven months old was crying and Kane
    grabbed her roughly by the neck, held her out, shook her at the same
    time, he walked out through the kitchen and threw the child flat on the
    ground with its face down, then turned and walked back into and store
    cursing the child and its mother. The next morning the mother got her
    things together and started for her home on Redwood creek. Arriving at
    the Klamath river which she had to cross she proceeded to cross over
    with her children and had almost reached the other side before Kane
    found that she was <span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>leaving. As soon as he discovered that she was
    going he ran into the store, grabbed his rifle and ran down the bank
    to the water’s edge and began firing. He fired several shots at her,
    the bullets striking close by but failing to strike her. She went to her
    home in the night, some twenty miles away, over a rough mountain trail
    and through heavy timber most of the way. She never came back. The
    Indians preventing him from following her that night was all that kept
    him from killing her. It got too warm for him and he sold the store to
    C. H. Johnson and afterwards went to the Indian woman on Redwood creek
    and remained there with her. This brute took the same little girl by
    her legs and dashed her brains out against a large redwood post, so
    every one said. The woman again had to flee for her life. She left for
    Hoopa Valley, where she could get some protection and Kane did not
    dare to follow her there. He drifted down on the coast and lived for a
    number of years but finally took sick and died in the County Hospital.
    The woman he had lived with and bore him children remained at Hoopa
    and raised the other children. Can you expect children, born to such
    fathers under such conditions to grow up to be good and respectable
    men and women? Many of them are a credit to their Indian mothers while
    those who have good respectable fathers and are born under wed-lock,
    having a birth that they can be proud of, over the average, make the
    best of men and women.</p>

  <p>I have strenuously fought the whiskey traffic carried on by the
    unprincipled white men for years and did all that I could to stop it,
    and made bitter enemies in doing so. Yet it is going on just the same
    under the very eyes of some of those who are employed by the U. S.
    Government to put it down. It looks as if they were paid to keep their
    eyes closed and not see it.</p>

  <p>When C. H. Johnson took over the store he cleaned it up and built an
    addition to it and put in a large stock of provisions, made friends
    with the Indians and did not keep any intoxicating liquors and he
    allowed no one to drink around the store. He gave the Indians good
    advice so that all looked up to him as a friend among them and he
    never meddled with any of their wives but treated them with respect,
    so that all could come and go, trade and chat with perfect ease and
    freedom. Many of them would lay their troubles before him and he would
    listen patiently and always try to give them good advice and keep down
    trouble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span> among them as far as it was in his power to do so. Mr. Johnson
    kept this store for over twenty-five years and the Indians never at
    any time made a threat against him or offered to harm him in any way.
    He began with the help of the settlers and succeeded in getting the
    government to establish a post office at the store and which he named
    Klamath Post office, while he was the Postmaster. He ran the Post
    office with the store and made a good official, striving at all times
    to do what he could for the patrons of the office. It was very few
    times that any complaint was made for mislaying mail. He ran the Post
    office for about twenty-two years and during this time many of the
    Indians sent letters and received others and he used to read their
    letters for them and did much of their correspondence for them. He kept
    the office until he died. Mr. Johnson used to keep quite a stock of
    patent medicines and acted as doctor to the Indians if any of them were
    sick, often going to see them and give them medicine if he thought by
    doing so he could cure them. In serious cases he would advise them to
    go to a white doctor which they would sometimes do.</p>

  <p>As Mr. Johnson never kept any whiskey, being opposed to selling it to
    the Indians, his neighbors now took advantage of the whiskey business
    and began to get it in quantities and sell it to the Indians and mixed
    bloods which still kept the quarrels going. It looks as if it will
    still continue so to the end. It is a well known fact that Mr. Johnson
    made money at the store and when he became sick he was attended by
    white men until he died. It was said that no money was found above a
    small sum. The stock of goods was run down until there was but little
    left. The reader can guess how this happened as Mr. Johnson never made
    a failure and always paid for his goods, his credit being good for
    whatever he ordered. He was the father of one daughter, her mother
    being a Klamath Indian woman. This daughter he always claimed as his
    child and made arrangements for her to have all he possessed at his
    death, but she will never get but little. He was buried upon the flat
    beside the grave of Mr. Bryson in a deplorable manner.</p>

  <p>A man by the name of Oscar Chapman, after the lapse of several weeks
    was sent up to take charge of the store until the estate could be
    settled. The Post office was moved from the store and Chapman continued
    to run the store about one year<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span> and kept whiskey to sell and ran
    gambling tables in the store. He meddled with the women, both married
    and single for which he was shot dead in ambush. The Coroner was sent
    up from Arcata to take charge of the body and brought it down to Arcata
    for burial.</p>

  <div class="figcenter illowp84" id="i_024">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i_024.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">BILL McGARVEY’S STORE.</div>
  </div>

  <p>Then a man named William Lawson was sent up there to take charge of
    the store and remained a few months and would not stay any longer. The
    order was given to him to sell all he could and box up the remainder
    and take what was left down to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span> the mouth of the Klamath by boat and
    store it there for safe keeping until some future time. Thus, the old
    store at Klamath Bluffs is dismantled and now stands there unoccupied.</p>

  <p>After the death of Mr. Johnson the Government put two lady matrons on
    the Klamath river to look after the interests of the Indians. They at
    once began to look after this store and made reports against it. The
    order came that no one could buy it or start it up as a trading post
    without first giving a bond in the sum of ten thousand dollars, yet it
    had been run by different men, sold a number of times and none had ever
    given any bonds for over fifty years.</p>

  <p>Around this store there are many tales woven, and I will tell quite a
    number of them, using this place as a center to start with, as this is
    where the lower Klamath Indians have their White Deer-Skin dance and
    a short distance above the store is where one of their sacred lodges
    is located. They have the true name of God which is used in the lodge
    only in a low whisper, and outside of the lodge when three or four of
    them are out in a secret place, and then only in a whisper when they
    are burning certain roots and herbs that give sweet and pleasant odors
    to their God. While the festival is being held all difficulties are
    settled. Those of lower birth at the present time are pretending to
    carry out the worship, but for the past few years have made a sorry
    affair of it.</p>

  <h3>MARRIAGE</h3>

  <p>In the high marriage of the Talth the woman is most beautifully dressed
    on her wedding day. A buck-skin dress all strung with beads and shells
    that clink and rattle with her ever graceful step. Her hair is parted
    in the middle, brought down on each side and rolled with the skin of
    the otter. This skin is nicely dressed or tanned and then cut into
    about one inch strips, thus holding the hair so it hangs down to their
    hips or lower, according to its length. Around her neck are strings of
    most beautifully arranged beads and of high value among them; they hang
    down to her waist, almost completely covering her chest. A buck skin,
    dressed and made as white as it can be made, goes over the shoulders
    and fastens around the neck and hangs down covering the back. This
    makes her very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span> beautiful. She is so quick in movement that one has
    to keep their eyes on her closely to see all of her actions, while
    she speaks low and softly. These high marriages are very few and this
    beautiful sight of the bride is seldom seen. The girls born of these
    marriages were always looked up to by the Indians. When these girls
    came along or were met by any children of other births, the latter
    would always get out of the trail and let them pass.</p>

  <p>The Klamath Indians never had a chief like the other large tribes but
    were ruled by these men and women of such births that became members of
    the order.</p>

  <p>Another system is the “half married” one, the woman taking her husband
    to her house to live with her. By this marriage she is the absolute
    boss of the man and has complete control of all the children. She has
    the power to correct her husband in all his actions and can send him
    out to hunt, fish or work just as she deems proper, he being a slave
    to her, as they usually both belong to the class that are slaves. It
    amuses one to hear them use the term against white men that marry white
    women, the man having no home of his own, and the woman taking him to
    her home. They say that white man is half married just the same as our
    people are half married and that the white man can not walk out at any
    time as he is not boss for the woman owns everything. They have a third
    form of marriage that belongs to the middle class. These marriages
    are considered by the whole tribe as good marriages and the children
    born by these marriages have a good standing in all walks of life. The
    marriage is performed by a part barter and trade, such as giving in
    exchange a boat or fishing place or any other property of a personal
    nature. This ceremony is more of the common than the imposing way.
    Since the coming of the white man he has brought this marriage around
    to a simple form of buying outright by giving a price as one would for
    a horse, cow or any other purchase. The old Indian law was an exchange
    of valuable articles and often the woman did not go to the man she
    married and live with him in his own home until they had been married
    one, two or three years.</p>

  <p>The Klamath Indians were, at the coming of the white man, a very large
    tribe, there being several thousand of them. It taxed every resource
    of the country in which they lived for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span> all of them to obtain a
    subsistence, therefore everything was owned in the same way that it is
    now owned by the white man. The land was divided up by the boundaries
    of the creeks, ridges and the river. All open prairies for gathering
    grass seeds, such as Indian wheat, which looks similar to rye, besides
    other kinds of seed; the oak timber for gathering acorns, the sugar
    pine for gathering pine nuts, the hazel flats for gathering hazel nuts
    and the fishing places for catching salmon.</p>

  <p>The most frugal and saving of the families had become the owners of
    these places and their ownership undisputed and these ownerships were
    handed down from one generation to another by will. In time this left
    a great many of them owning no property by which they could make a
    living and many of their own people became slaves to the wealthy class.
    They made the slaves work and kept them from starving, and by this
    there came about the “half married” system. There are some of these
    Indians that were born slaves living yet, and they are the ones that
    are always ready to tell the white man all of the Indian legends in a
    way to fit their own cases. They cannot tell the true legends at all,
    as they are ignorant of such facts. The wealthy ones would see that the
    men got wives and that the girls got husbands, build them houses and
    some families were very kind to their slaves. When they were sick they
    saw that they had doctors and the proper care. Some families were mean
    and over-bearing to their slaves, giving no care to the sick, letting
    them die and going so far as to throw them into a hole, leaving them
    there to suffer and starve until they died. This sort of treatment
    was looked down upon by the ones that had better humane feelings and
    they sometimes prevented such inhuman actions. The most of the doctors
    are women and they exercised great power, especially those who had a
    high standing as to family, and the art of curing most all diseases or
    cases of sickness. A few of the doctors were men and they used roots
    and herbs of different kinds and they are hard to beat as doctors in a
    great many kinds of sickness. They can cure the bite of a rattle snake,
    not one of them ever dying from the bite. I knew many of the people
    that were bitten by the rattle snake at different times and they were
    cured and lived to be very old. For this cure they use salt water out
    of the ocean and the root or the onion of what you call kelp and which
    is taken out of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span> ocean. They pound the onion of the kelp and make
    a poultice out of it, place it over the wound and keep it wet with the
    salt water, at the same time letting the patient drink all he can of
    the salt water. The patient is kept perfectly still and not allowed to
    move about more than is necessary. They bind the limb or place where
    the part is bitten to prevent the free circulation of the blood through
    these parts.</p>

  <p>In other things they are equally as good. In child-birth they prepare
    a woman for giving birth to her child and at the birth of the child
    they have an old woman to take care of the mother and child. After the
    birth of the child the cord is cut and tied, then they take the black
    part of a large snail, which has an oily substance, and place it over
    the navel. They put a bandage around the child which is kept there for
    some time. I have never known an Indian of the old tribe to be ruptured
    and yet they do not know anything about surgery. If anything of a
    serious nature happens to a woman during child-birth they are at a loss
    to know what to do to save her. If the woman gives birth to twins and
    they are a boy and girl, they try to raise them both, but if it be two
    boys or girls they pick one of them and raise it while the other one is
    neglected and starved to death, and when it died they went through all
    the forms of sorrow by crying and mourning over the loss of the child
    just the same as if they tried to raise it. If anything happens to the
    mother that causes her death at child-birth or after and the child is
    yet an infant, they take sugar-pine nuts or hazel nuts and pound them
    into fine flower and mix this in warm water, making a milky substance
    out of it. They can raise a child on this preparation as well as if it
    was nursed at the mother’s breast. Every family in the olden times was
    very careful to keep a good supply of pine and hazel nuts on hand.</p>

  <p>The Indians were preservers of the sugar-pine timber which grew on the
    high ranges of mountains on the north side of the river and there was a
    very heavy fine and also death to the Indian that willfully destroyed
    any of this timber. The sugar from these trees was also used by them
    as a medicine in different cases of sickness. The salt water mussels
    that they gather which cling to the rocks close to the sea-shore, is an
    article of food for them and they gather and eat them while fresh by
    boiling them. They also dry them and take them up the river to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span> their
    homes for winter use. In the month of August and a part of September
    these mussels become poisoned, in some years worse than in others, with
    phosphorus. Sometimes whole families would get poisoned by eating them
    out of season and in this case they use the sugar which is taken from
    the sugar-pine tree and which is a sure cure if taken in time. This
    made the Indian prize the sugar-pine tree very highly and putting to
    death even a member of their own tribe who harmed a tree in any way.</p>

  <p>In the early days when a white man arrived among the Indians, he took
    an Indian woman, and in the fall of the year she would want to gather
    some pine nuts, the white man would go with her, taking his axe,
    and cut down the tree, as he could not climb it, and told the woman
    there they are, what are you going to do about it? At first the woman
    complained and finally said that the white man would spoil everything.
    Then the Indians began to cut the trees. In the last few years these
    trees have become very valuable in the eyes of the white man, and it
    has become the complaint of the white man that the Indians ought to be
    arrested and punished. Some of them have gone so far as to say that
    the Indians ought to be shot for cutting down this fine timber for the
    nuts. I leave the reader to decide which one ought to be punished for
    the cutting of the great number of these fine sugar-pine trees.</p>

  <p>The Indians also took the greatest of care of the hazel nut flats as
    the nuts are used in many ways. The nuts were gathered and stored away
    as they could be kept for a long time and could be pounded into flour,
    put into warm water and made a good substitute for milk which could be
    used for weak, sickly children, also in some cases for sick persons
    that needed nourishment and had weak stomachs. The hazel is used in all
    of their basket making, as the frame of all the baskets are made of the
    hazel sticks. In taking care of the hazel flats they got out in the
    dry summer or early in the fall months and burn the hazel brush, then
    the next spring the young shoots started up from the old roots. On the
    following spring in the month of May, when the sap rises and the shoots
    start to grow, the women go forth and gather these young shoots which
    are from one to two feet in length. Some of these sticks grow up to a
    height of three feet and are gathered for making the large baskets and
    also the wood baskets. They gather these sticks by the thousands and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
    take them home where the women, children and men all join in peeling
    the bark off the sticks. They take up a handful in the right hand, then
    place the butt end of one of them in their mouth, taking hold of it with
    their teeth and the left hand, giving it a twist so as to peel the bark
    around the end, and as they get the bark started they give the stick
    one quick jerk and the bark peels off at one effort. After they are
    peeled they are laid out in the sun, on a smooth place, in thin layers
    and allowed to bleach and dry and when they are dried they gather them
    up and assort them out according to their size and length, and tie
    the different sizes in bundles and lay them away for use, sometimes
    three or four years later, before they are made up into baskets. The
    small sticks are used for making up the very fine baskets. The reader
    can easily see by this why the hazel was preserved and not destroyed
    as it had a great value to them in many ways. They made withes of
    it for tying their boats and other things. The oak timber they were
    very careful to preserve as they gathered the acorns from it late in
    the fall, October and November. The oak tree furnished them with the
    staff of life, as it was from the acorn they made all their bread and
    mush and this bread they could take for use on long journeys on their
    hunting trips. They would wrap up a large lump of dough and placing
    it in a cool place, keep it for several days before it would begin to
    spoil or sour. From this dough they made their mush by taking a piece
    about the size of a tea cup and put it into one of the baskets, fill it
    nearly full with water, then take some wash stones taken from the river
    or creek and put them in the fire until they were hot and often red-hot
    when they would take two sticks and lift them out, drop them into the
    basket and stir the whole briskly with a paddle, made for this purpose,
    they would soon have it boiling and by putting in another stone and
    with a little more stirring they would soon have the basket of mush
    cooked. They call this mush Ka-go and it is very nutritious and gives
    great power of endurance. After the basket of mush has been set aside
    for thirty or forty minutes it is then dipped out into small baskets
    made for the purpose and of size to fit the stomach. One person serves,
    handing out the mush together with a piece of dry salmon or venison or
    different things that may be prepared for eating. The acorn furnishes
    the bread to all the Klamath river Indians.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span></p>

  <p>All the oak timber was owned by the well-to-do families and was divided
    off by lines and boundaries as carefully as the whites have got it
    surveyed today. It can easily be seen by this that the Indians have
    carefully preserved the oak timber and have never at any time destroyed
    it.</p>

  <p>The Douglas fir timber they say has always encroached on the open
    prairies and crowded out the other timber, therefore they have
    continuously burned it and have done all they could to keep it from
    covering all the open lands. Our legends tell when they arrived in the
    Klamath river country that there were thousands of acres of prairie
    lands and with all the burning that they could do the country has been
    growing up to timber more and more.</p>

  <p>The redwood timber they use for making their canoes and building their
    houses. In making a canoe they took a redwood log in length and size to
    suit the canoe they wanted to make, and split the log in half, shaping
    the bottom of the canoe first, then turning it over and chipping off
    the top until they get it down to the right place when they would
    start shaping the guards; after this they dug out the inside, leaving
    it a certain thickness and this they gauged by placing one hand
    outside and the other inside, moving both hands slowly along—and it is
    surprising how even the thickness is in all parts. They cut out the
    seat in the stern with a place to put each foot on the side in front
    of the seat so one can brace himself while paddling it with a long
    and narrow paddle, pointed at the end, so they can paddle or push the
    canoe with it. They are certainly expert in the Klamath river with a
    canoe, either the men or women. They have no keel on their canoes,
    just a round smooth bottom, with a rounded bow and stern. A large
    hazel withe is put through holes in the corners of the bow and drawn
    very tight across it so as to keep the canoe from splitting in case it
    strikes the rocks very hard, which often happens, as they grind upon
    the rocks in the rough places in the river. These canoes will carry
    heavy loads, much larger than they would seem to carry; sometimes from
    forty to one hundred and fifty sacks of flour at a load. In making a
    canoe, the Indians always leave in the bottom and some two feet back
    from the front or bow, a knob some three inches across and about two
    inches high, with a hole about one inch deep dug into it, and this
    they call the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span> heart of the canoe and without this the canoe would be
    dead. When I was a young woman no Indian would use a canoe unless it
    had the heart left in it to make it alive, as it was not safe to use if
    not thus fixed, something after the fashion or notion of the sailors
    as to a vessel being christened. The redwood canoes are being used for
    a distance of one hundred miles up the Klamath river but the redwood
    is used only for a distance of about thirty miles up the river, for
    houses, after this distance they use red fir for houses. The redwood
    is a soft, easy timber for working and not susceptible to being sun
    cracked and is an ideal wood for making a canoe. After they have
    finished making the canoe they take the shavings and some dry brush and
    burn it both inside and outside and then brush off the dry parts which
    leaves it very light and dry. After using the canoe for a few days and
    if any light cracks start in it they take it out, dry it perfectly and
    go over it with pitch taken from the fir tree. In doing this they first
    put the pitch on the cracks then put hot rocks on the pitch which melts
    it and it fills up the cracks. After this treatment the canoe will last
    for years.</p>

  <p>Their tools for working timber were very crude and they had to work
    very slow. For axes and wedges they used the elk horn. They would cut
    the horn to the length preferred with flint and then use a granite rock
    where the quartz would adhere to it making it very rough, and with this
    they would whet the horn into shape. After this they put grease on them
    and lay them up so that the fire would dry the grease into them, until
    it became very tough and could be used for years before wearing out.
    For their malls or hammers they took a granite rock and by pecking on
    it, could work it down to about one foot in length, then work it down
    so that at one end it would be about four inches across the face of it
    and the other end about two inches across it, while in the middle they
    would bring it to about one inch, making it so one could hold it with
    ease, using the large end for the mall part. With these crude tools
    they cut trees, made their canoes and houses, by the aid of the fire to
    help in many ways. They could split up a log into slabs and get some
    nice looking lumber, only rough and of different thickness and in this
    way they could build a very warm and comfortable house. In building
    a house they leveled off a piece of ground from thirty to forty feet
    square, then beginning in the center of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span> square they dug down about
    five feet and from twelve to twenty feet across, surrounding this
    part they dug a trench two feet deep and in this they set the slabs
    or boards up endwise, being careful to put thick ones at each of the
    four corners with holes burned through the top ends. These boards were
    about eight feet long, which would leave them about six feet above the
    ground on two sides. To this they tied with hazel withes a heavy pole
    of the same size across the two gable ends on the same level of the
    side poles. They tamped the ground in tightly around these boards the
    same on all sides. At one corner of the gable end they had a very wide
    plank about four feet in width and about four inches thick; they cut
    out a hole in this plank about two feet across and around this they
    put in about two feet from the corner setting it down in the trench,
    tramping it very solid, for the door. Then they put across the top from
    four to six very heavy poles for rafters, the two top poles being only
    about three feet apart, with one a little lower than the other so as to
    give it a slope for the water to run off when it rained. Then they tied
    all this with hazel withes until the whole thing is fastened solidly
    together and after this part is finished they put on the roof, using
    the same heavy slabs which are about eight feet long, doubling them so
    as to make it rain proof while the center part or comb of the roof is
    short slabs about four feet long and in the center they leave a large
    wide plank, so they can raise it to a slanting position so as to keep
    the rain out and at the same time let the smoke out. After the roof
    planks are all placed they put the large poles across the top, over
    the joints and tie them down to the ones under with the hazel withes,
    making it all quite substantial as to strength. Then they make a hole
    in the center of the basement about one foot deep and side this up
    with stones to fit for a fire-place, making it very smooth, then put
    gravel in the bottom of the fire-place to the thickness of four inches
    in depth. They then put a plank wall all the way around the house or
    basement part holding them firmly to their place, after the fashion of
    the white man’s wainscoting. After this they take a good quality of
    clay, wet it with water until they get it to suit and plaster it over
    the floor of the basement, tramping it until they get it plastered
    over about four inches thick, while it is drying they keep very close
    watch of it, and where it starts to crack they go over it with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span> more
    clay, filling in the cracks. They keep the cracks filled until the
    floor becomes very dry and hard and this makes a very smooth floor.
    They smooth off the upper floor which is irregular in shape and place a
    slab or post at the four places which come opposite the corners of the
    house, back about one foot from the wall and under one of the rafter
    poles, so as to give support to the rafters. Then they put in an inside
    partition in front of the door, letting this come back some ten feet
    on each side of the door, reaching up to the roof and an inside door,
    which is like the white man’s door. This is a place fixed in all the
    houses for keeping their winter’s wood in while the rest of the place
    is for storing away their provisions for the winter months, such as
    dried salmon, eels, acorns and the other kinds of food which they store
    in large baskets, some of these baskets are large enough for a man to
    lie down in. Some of the girls make their beds in this upper part of
    the house for the summer months. In a house where there is a large
    family this upper part of the house is well filled with baskets holding
    the different articles of food-stuffs, some of which have been stored
    there for a number of years. They have shutters to both the outside and
    inside doors and the roof projects well out all around the house, which
    makes the house warm in the winter time and cool in the summer. Going
    down into the basement they take a log about one foot through and cut
    the right length, cut notches in it for footsteps and set it in place
    and the little Indian children can go up and down this like squirrels
    with less accidents than the whites have on their stairs. The whole
    family eats in the basement and all the cooking is done there and at
    night things are cleared away and all the women and girls sleep in this
    basement, while the men and boys all go to the sweat-houses to sleep.
    Outside in front of the door they make a sort of porch, the floor of
    which is made of smooth rocks, thus completing the house. In going
    through the doors they have to stoop very low and almost in a crawling
    position and raise straight up on entering the inside. The inner door
    is high and they can stand up on going through it. The doors in most
    cases face toward the river. One of these houses will stand for fifty
    years and with some repairing will stand a great while. There were
    from ten to forty of these houses in a village and the villages were
    from one half to three miles apart, some on one side and some on the
    other side of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span> river. Generally there was a sweat-house to each
    dwelling but sometimes there was only one sweat-house for two houses.
    The men and boys visited from one sweat-house to another for a social
    time and to remain over night. The Indians that travelled up and down
    the river used to stop with old friends or relatives and would get in
    the sweat-house, exchange news and smoke their pipes until a late hour
    in the night. There is no law forbidding the women from sleeping in a
    sweat-house, but the men say the women have too many fleas on them and
    the women say the men talk too much, so the women let the men sweep,
    get the wood and make their own fires in the sweat-houses. Sometimes
    an Indian will take his wife or favorite daughter to the sweat-house
    to sleep if the weather is cold but the women prefer to sleep in the
    dwelling houses as they are very comfortable there and can be kept very
    warm with a small fire. The women make a sort of mattress of the tules
    that grow in the swamps. They gather this tule, let it dry and bleach
    it, then take strings of their own make and commencing in the middle of
    the string they lay one of the stalks of the tule and plat them closely
    together. They weave the tules close together, putting about six
    strings in a mat about three or four feet wide and have the mat five or
    six feet in length, sometimes making them three and four thicknesses
    which they can fold up and put out of the way in the day-time and take
    out and unfold at night. These mats are quite comfortable to sleep
    on. The old women sleep on the basement floors while the young girls
    sleep on the upper floors in the warm months and on the lower floors,
    with the old women during the cold months. My people were in the habit
    of eating but two meals a day, the first meal or breakfast came about
    eleven o’clock and in the evening, after dark the women prepare the
    supper, the menu differing according to the season of the year.</p>

  <p>As soon as it begins to get cold the men would go out and get large
    loads of small limbs and brush, tie it up in a bundle which they placed
    on their backs and held with both hands and as they came in they sang
    a song for luck in whatever they might wish for, such as making money,
    good health and many other things. With this wood they make a fire in
    the sweat-house and the smoke coming out of the crevices would make
    it look as if the house was afire for a short time, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span> the wood
    would burn down to a bed of coals and the smoke all disappeared and
    then the men and boys would strip and creep into them, one at a time
    and in about thirty or forty minutes would all come crawling out of
    the small round door, steaming and covered with perspiration weak and
    limp, appearing as if they could hardly stand up. After crawling out
    they lay flat on the stone platform that is fixed for the purpose and
    sing the same songs, only at this time in a more doleful way. They lay
    in this way for thirty or forty minutes, then get up and still looking
    weak start off down to the bank of the river, one at a time, and plunge
    into the cold water and swim and splash for a time, then all go back to
    the dwelling house and go in where the women folks are preparing the
    evening meal, take their seats around the basement floor, out of the
    way of the women while they are cooking, and all will join in laughing
    and talking until the evening meal is over. Then the men and boys go
    back to the sweat-house for the night and prepare for a big smoke, all
    laughing and talking about different topics and telling amusing tales.
    Some of the older ones would discuss points on Indian law, others tell
    how things are changing, how this and that used to be and is different
    now, how they fought the other tribes, when they were victorious and
    when they were defeated, praising one that was the leader or condemning
    another, one that was a good general and many other things, and some
    were very interesting talkers. They talked until they were ready to go
    to sleep for the night and then they would place the wooden pillows
    under their heads. Some of them would not use any kind of covering and
    would be almost naked, as the sweat-houses would keep very warm for at
    least twelve hours after a big fire had been built in them. Early in
    the morning they would come out and each take his own way for the day,
    such as hunting, trapping, fishing or getting something that might be
    needed for the family. The old men dressed deer skins, many of which
    the hair was left on and these were for the women to use as blankets
    and for shawl-like coats which they wear, for moccasins (noch-i)
    they take a dressed deer-skin and smoke it and then make it up into
    moccasins. They make dresses and many other things out of skins. Others
    would dress furs which they use in many ways. They use the Fisher
    skin for quivers to carry arrows in, also the young Panther skin. The
    fresh water Otter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span> they dress very nicely for the women to tie their
    hair with. Some would make mauls and wedges for future use and others
    were making bows and arrows, while a few would give directions to
    the others. The women went about their work such as pounding acorns,
    soaking the flour and preparing it to make bread or mush, some cutting
    fresh salmon and preparing it for cooking, others go out after wood for
    their part of the living and cooking quarters and others made baskets
    for cooking purposes. Some made hats and baskets they used for storing
    away food, while others made fine dresses for wearing and anything that
    was to be done, but few of them being idle, unless it was some of the
    old women that were very wealthy. The Klamath people have the same kind
    of tobacco that grows over a large part of the United States, which,
    when it grows up has small leaves. They prepare the ground and plant
    the seed but will not use any they find growing out of cultivation.
    They are very careful in gathering the plant and cure it by the fire,
    or in the hot sun, then pulverize it very fine, then put it up in tight
    baskets for use. It becomes very strong and often makes the oldest
    smokers sick, which they pass over lightly, saying that it is a good
    quality of tobacco. The women doctors all smoke but the other women
    never do. Their pipes are made out of yew wood with a soap-stone for a
    bowl, the wood is a straight piece and is from three to six inches long
    and is larger at the bowl end where it joins on to the stone, it is
    notched in so it sets the bowl on the wood, making the pipe straight.
    They hold the pipe upwards if sitting or standing and it is only when
    lying on the back that one seems to enjoy the smoke with perfect ease,
    however they can handle the pipe to take a smoke in any position. Some
    of these pipes are small, not holding any more than a thimble-full of
    tobacco. My people never let the tobacco habit get the better of them
    as they can go all day without smoking or quit smoking for several days
    at a time and never complain in the least. The men, after supper, on
    going into the sweat-house take their pipes and smoke and some take two
    or three smokes before they go to bed. The old women doctors will smoke
    through the day and always take a smoke before lying down to sleep. All
    inhale the smoke, letting it pass out of the lungs through the nose.</p>

  <p>Women doctors are made and educated, which comes about in a very
    peculiar way. They are usually from the daughter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span> of wealthy families.
    Most of them begin quite young, and often the doctor will take one of
    her daughters that she selects along with her and begin by teaching
    her to smoke and help her in her attendance on the sick, and at the
    right time will commence with her at the sweat-house; while others will
    have a dream that they are doctors and then the word will be given
    out, and in either case along in the late fall all will be made ready,
    the day being set. The sweat-house (which is the white man’s name and
    does not have the same meaning in our language, we call it Ur-girk)
    being selected they take her to it, dressed with a heavy skirt that
    comes down to her ankles and which is made of the inner bark of the
    maple, with her arms and breast bare. They all go into the sweat-house,
    there being from fifteen to twenty men and women in number, she having
    a brother or cousin, sometimes two, that look after her. All begin
    to sing songs that are used for the occasion, dance jumping up and
    down, going slowly around the fire and to the right, they keep this
    up until she is wet with perspiration as wet as the water could make
    her and when she gets so tired that she can stand up no longer one of
    her brothers or cousins take her on his back with her arms around his
    neck and keep her going until she is completely exhausted, then they
    take her out and into the house. There she is bathed in warm water
    and then allowed to sleep as long as she wishes, which revives her
    and gives her back her strength. On awakening she appears rested and
    vigorous, with a beautiful complexion. She can now eat her meal such as
    is allowed her. While she is training for a doctor she is not allowed
    to drink any water or eat any fresh salmon, all the water she gets is
    in the acorn mush or in the manzanita berry, pounded to a flour and
    then mixed with water, made into a sort of mush and warmed. They are
    allowed to eat all other kinds of food. These dances are kept up at
    intervals all through the winter months until late in the spring, when
    they will take her far back on the high mountains and keep her there
    all through the summer, never allowing her to drink water, only as
    mixed with mush, nor eat any fresh salmon. In the fall they bring her
    back home to the river when she will go through the same performance in
    the sweat-house. Sometimes she will be from three to ten years before
    being ready for the final graduation exercises when she will be taken
    back to some almost inaccessible place on a high peak<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span> or on a very
    high rock where they will smoke, pray and fast for from three to five
    days. While at this place none eat or drink and on leaving it the pipes
    are left secreted so as to be found on the next visit. On this trip
    there will not be more than three or four with her and always one of
    them is an old doctor so as to care for her, and on coming back, after
    they get down the hill part way to a suitable place they make a stop
    and all eat and take a rest. The young doctor bathes herself, loosens
    her hair and washes it, then dries it and combs it with a bone knife.
    These knives of deer bone, about the size of a table knife and have a
    hole bored through the handle and a string tied through it and fastens
    around the wrist, and in carrying it the point of the blade is up
    and lays against the arm so that a person would hardly know that she
    carried it. This comb is beautifully carved and checkered with black
    stripes. She gently strokes the hair with it until it is dry, then she
    thrusts the point through it, close to the head, gently pressing the
    blade down through it, she keeps the comb in motion until the hair
    is perfectly straight and glossy and then she parts the hair in the
    middle of the forehead, then takes stripes of Otter skin and ties it
    up, letting it hang down on each side of the head and in front of each
    shoulder. This girl is a virgin, as perfect in statue and active in
    movement and health as God can make her. She can bear hardships and
    punishment without complaint or murmur, that would make a bear whine.
    After all have rested they start for home which will perhaps take them
    two or three days to reach and all the time her health is looked after
    to see that she is in good spirits and does not become wearied, and on
    arriving home she is allowed to rest for two, three or four weeks when
    all is made ready to give her the final degree. This time preparing
    one of the large living houses for the purpose, by taking off a part
    of the roof and fixing it so that all can come and get a chance to see
    the whole performance. The time is set and word is sent all up and down
    the river and at the appointed time they will be there, some coming for
    many miles to see and take part in giving the young doctor her final
    degree. At sun down the fire is made in the center of the living room
    and at the commencement of the hour of darkness she is brought in, goes
    through the door and down into the basement, takes her place, when
    the others that are to help her take their places,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span> forming a circle
    around the fire and all start singing in a low and monotonous voice,
    jumping up and down, the young doctor taking care of herself at first
    and taking instructions from the old doctor who sits close by but takes
    no part other than to instruct her. After keeping this up for from two
    to four hours the young doctor becomes very warm and fatigued and they
    keep close watch of her until the time comes, when one of the men takes
    hold of her and holds her up and helps her to stand, still wearing her
    down until two men take hold of her by each arm and in this way keep
    her dancing until she is helpless and so limp that she can no longer
    go on. Then they lay her up and out of the way, still keeping on with
    the ceremony until daylight in the morning, when all repair to their
    places to sleep for a few hours, then arise, go forth, bathe and eat
    and go back to their homes. The young doctor does not always go through
    this ordeal and come out safely, as sometimes she became so warm that
    she would never recover from the effects of the severe punishment,
    but this seldom happens. After going through this she is pronounced a
    doctor and can begin practicing her profession. She is now allowed to
    get married if she so desires and the most of them do and raise large
    families and live to be very old. They wield a big influence among
    the tribe if they are successful as doctors and some of them are very
    successful as doctors while others are of the ordinary class. These
    women doctors are seers, as when they are called to doctor the sick
    they claim to tell what is the cause of the sickness and what will cure
    it. They suck the body where the pain is located and sing in a sort of
    chanting way for awhile, then suck the body again and keep this up for
    four or six hours, if it is a serious case there will be two doctors
    and sometimes three and in this case they will not agree as to the
    cause, if the patient gets well there will be one of them that gets the
    credit for the greater part of it and sometimes all of it. When there
    is a case of sickness, the relatives of the sick one decides on the
    doctor, and the amount of money or other valuables, or all valuables
    just as they may, go to the doctor and laying it before her at which
    she will accept or refuse the offer, but if it is satisfactory she will
    prepare to go with them and if it is rejected she will demand more and
    sometimes she will call for some valuable relic which she knows the
    family has in their possession, sometimes an article that has in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span> years
    gone by been in the doctor’s own family, and she will strive to get it
    back again. If the sick one should die while she is trying to get more
    they will make her pay to them all that they have laid down to her,
    but if she accepts the money and goes and the patient dies, then they
    make her return all that was given to her. If there was two or three
    doctors then they all have to return all that was given to them and
    then they will debate among themselves as to which one of the doctors
    is the best. Some of the doctors were very successful and hardly ever
    lost a patient, and accumulated great wealth, owning the best fishing
    places and large tracts of land where they could gather acorns, hazel
    nuts and grass seeds, besides many slaves. They were great talkers and
    always had a ready answer to every question, and were almost habitual
    smokers, using a large pipe and smoking often. They had a wonderful
    constitution. To give an idea of the power of one of these most
    successful doctors I will give a sketch of one and her methods. This
    doctor was born at Cortep village and of a wealthy family who had been
    for many generations back. She married a man that was born at Pec-wan
    village, also of a wealthy family and would be called after marriage
    in the Indian tongue as Peck-wish-on, but not in this case as she was
    called by the tribes as Caw. She became famous among her people and
    would come out of her house and sit on the porch of the stone platform
    in front of her door, take off her cap, stroke her hair down over her
    face and eyes and sit this way for hours at a time, and all, young and
    old, would become afraid of her and say; look at Caw, she will make
    some one sick, and there would be such a dread of her that there was
    sure to be some one sick in two or three days, then they would say
    that Caw made them sick, and if they could get her to doctor the sick
    one she would cure the sick one as she seldom ever failed to cure any
    of her cases. She doctored and took all the wealth of her mother and
    father into her own hands besides all that her brothers and sisters and
    other relatives had, for doctoring them. She lived to be quite old and
    had raised a family of boys and girls. She had lots of slaves, land
    and fishing places and money. Her son was the richest Indian in the
    whole tribe and was known as Pec-wan Colonel. I knew a girl that this
    doctor took for a doctor bill and who was to be the wife of one of her
    grandsons. But as the grandson and girl grew up to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span> be of marriageable
    age he did not want her for his wife and the money was returned, which
    freed her and she married another man, one of choice. These doctors
    never act in cases of child-birth, nor do they ever attend or have
    any part in these cases. An old woman that is always very pleasant
    takes these cases, taking charge of the woman that is about to become
    a mother and prepares her for the task of giving birth. She has a
    medicine which she prepares and gives to the woman which does not fail
    to do its work in a very short time. This is the pitch or gum of the
    fir tree, that has by fires or otherwise dropped into the waters of the
    creeks or streams and laid in the water for a long time which makes it
    very brittle and hard. They take a piece of this and after pounding
    it until it becomes as fine as flour put it into a cup of water and
    let the patient drink, which in most cases brings her out in good
    condition. This is not the only remedy they have for they have many for
    use in the different condition of the patient; the baby is also cared
    for by these women. They wash the child and dress it in soft furs, such
    as rabbit skins or other soft kinds of fur. They now pound hazel nuts
    into flour, put it into warm water which makes a kind of milk and then
    feed it to the child, they also take milk from the mother’s breast and
    give to the baby, they do not let the baby nurse at the mother’s breast
    until after the first ten days, at which time the child is allowed to
    do so until time to wean it. The baby is provided with a basket made
    for the purpose and the child is placed in this in a sitting position,
    it has a strap fastened in the back so that the mother can swing it
    across her back, set it up against the wall or lay it down flat just as
    she may choose. The baby if in health will doodle its feet and laugh
    when any one takes notice of it. The baby baskets are changed in size
    as the baby grows older and larger, the older baskets are burned. These
    granny women are called Na-gaw-ah-clan. The Klamath Indians have men
    doctors and they use many kinds of roots, herbs and some minerals, and
    when it comes to wounds, bites of poisonous reptiles, chronic diseases,
    women are ailing with such disease as falling of the womb and many
    other kinds of sickness, they are called by rich families, and they
    too are paid in advance and if they fail to cure they have to return
    the money or if they refuse to come and the patient dies they have
    to make good all that was offered them. These men doctors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span> hand down
    their secrets of the different kinds of medicines they use and for
    what each kind is used, to their sons or close relatives, and before
    one begins to practice he goes back on the mountains to some distant
    and secluded place where there is a large rock or high peak, where he
    can look over the whole surrounding country all alone. There he prays
    to his God for health, strength and success. He does not drink water
    or eat and punishes himself as much as he can and stands up under the
    strain, he is gone from eight to twelve days and on his return he
    bathes himself, rests and sleeps, smokes his pipe for three or four
    weeks and then is ready to take up the calling of the doctor and will
    go with the old doctors for quite awhile so as to make sure that he
    makes no mistake in handling the cases nor in the uses of the different
    kinds of medicine to be used for different cases or diseases. These
    men doctors are called Pe-girk-ka-gay, the women doctors being called
    Kay-gay. Most of the men doctors are of the highest birth and are often
    members of the highest families and are often members of the secret
    lodge. It is only them that stop the women doctors and make them many
    of their accusations or retract their sayings, thus keeping them in
    bounds of reason, though they are very lenient with them and often let
    them go too far before they stop them. These men doctors help to start
    and to make the settlements for the white Deer-skin dance, and this
    is the time when all troubles between individuals, clans and villages
    are settled, so the whole tribe is in peace. If any of them are not
    willing to settle their difficulties they are strictly forbidden to
    attend the worship, and if they should attend they would lose the
    respect of the whole tribe, besides they would be dealt with harshly.
    So in case there be some that cannot make a settlement it is best for
    them to remain away for this is a time and place where all is free and
    the best of good cheer and behavior must prevail. The White Deer-skin
    Dance they hold every two years unless something of a serious nature
    happens and which sometimes did happen and so crippled the people that
    they could not hold them for a number of years, such as contagious
    diseases or other calamities. In years that everything was all right
    these men doctors would get together about the last of July or the
    first of August and have a talk and settle the question and give out
    the announcement that they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span> were going to have the Deer-skin Dance
    (Oh-pure-ah-wah). The word would be sent out to all the Indians up
    and down the river, to the Hoopa and Smith river Indians and down the
    coast as far as Trinidad, and any and all of them of the other tribes
    could come and see the dance and none of them would ever be molested.
    Now they would begin to settle all of their quarrels among themselves
    by paying, this was done by arbitration in most of the cases, as they
    would select the ones that were friends to both sides of the ones in
    dispute. They would argue the case and bring them to a settlement if
    possible, and if they could not make a settlement they could not come
    to see the dance. This way things would move along and all kinds of
    sayings would be learned and disputed as those that had no authority
    would be guessing and often times give out something as coming from
    some of the head men. All would believe it to be true until it got far
    enough when the head ones would pronounce it as not authoritative and
    the false sayings would stop. Another false story would take its place
    and this would go on until about the middle of August when the Talth
    would get together and set the time for the dance to start. They always
    put in the fish dam first, it being a part of this great festival.</p>

  <p>The one that handles the putting in of the fish dam is known as Lock,
    and the fish dam is called La-og-gen. Lock selects one other of the
    high priests and one girl of equal high birth and the three go to a
    secluded place out on a high mountain from which place they can have a
    good view of the surrounding country and there the girl makes a small
    fire and is given instructions of how and what to do. The other man is
    also directed what to do. Lock unrolls his emblems, which is a closely
    woven scroll that is absolutely water proof and takes from it the roots
    that he burns slowly over the fire that the maiden keeps burning. These
    roots are burned as an incense and have a sweet odor as they burn, and
    while they are burning Lock prays and sings to God to give him health
    and power to carry through all the hardships of putting in the dam.
    They remain here for two days and nights, then go back down the river
    to where the fish dam is to be placed. There they land with their boat
    and stop at a very large rock which is close up to the water’s edge,
    and a large creek of clear pure water which enters into the river just
    at and a little below this large rock.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span> In the middle of the night the
    maiden gets wood and starts a small fire and fixes things for Lock
    and his helper. This girl is a virgin of purity. She goes across the
    river and bathes herself and dresses her hair, using her Indian knife
    like a comb, which she carries fastened to her wrist, until her hair
    is dry and glossy, then she lets it hang loose, wearing a band around
    her head made of beads which keeps the hair from falling over her face,
    just coming to the jaw, and if at any time the hair comes over her
    face she strokes it back with her Indian comb, but she never touches
    her hair with her hands. After she has bathed and dressed she goes to
    the lodge and lies down and sleeps until late in the morning when Lock
    and his helper come to the lodge and lie down and sleep until late
    in the morning when Lock-nee and his helper come to the lodge, when
    the three of them all take a bath, and then eat for the first time
    since they started. None of them are allowed any water and will not
    be allowed to drink any for many days yet. Some of these people would
    start in looking fine and when they came out they would often look
    like a walking skeleton, they would soon regain their flesh although
    sometimes they never would regain their normal condition. These three
    keep themselves secluded and no one has seen or heard of them, but all
    are anxiously waiting to hear the word. After they have had their meal,
    Lock and his helper go back across to the large rock, then Lock unrolls
    his scroll, burns some more incense and gives his order to his helper
    to go out to all the villages and call on as many to come forward and
    help to put in the fish dam as is needed, and this is the time for them
    to appear before Lock. Sometimes there will be from one hundred to two
    hundred young men, no old or sickly ones are wanted. After they all
    appear before Lock, he assigns to each lot of eight or ten of them,
    the part and amount that they are to do. After this they go home, fix
    up their provisions and camp outfit and in about thirty hours’ time the
    river bars in and around this place are alive with Indians, and the air
    is filled with merriment and jokes.</p>

  <p>Early in the morning they all start out without eating, and cut the
    small pines that are from two to three inches through at the butt
    ends. Some will make a fire, and as the others are cutting and packing
    in they will take the green pine poles and run them through the fire
    until they are scorched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span> then take them out and the bark is peeled off
    easily. While they are yet hot they split each one in two and four
    pieces, then others get long hazel withes and run them through the fire
    and while they are hot split them in two pieces, then they take them
    and the pine pieces and plat them together like mats, leaving the pine
    sticks about one and two inches apart, these mats when set upon end
    are about nine feet long, with five or six hazel withes about fourteen
    inches apart. After they get a mat put together they roll it up, making
    each mat so that one man can pack it on his shoulder and at a given
    time they all carry them down to the river to the place where the fish
    dam is to be put in. Others get the posts which are about eleven feet
    long and five or six inches through, they are all sharpened at one end
    and made very smooth, all the bark being taken off. Some get the long
    pole-beams or girders which are from twenty to twenty-four feet long
    and about six or seven inches through with the bark taken off. The girl
    that carries the true name of God is, during the day, in the lodge or
    house that is used only on these occasions. This house was kept in
    good condition at all times but no one lives in it, except on these
    occasions, also the sweat-house that Lock sleeps in while this work
    is going on. In the evening, about dusk, after all the workers have
    retired for the day, she quietly goes out and crosses the river, as
    Lock’s helper at this time is watching for her and takes the canoe over
    to take her where Lock is concealed under the large rock close to the
    bank of the river, and she gathers a quantity of dry wood by which Lock
    keeps a small fire burning all through the day and on which he burns
    incense. Lock keeps out of sight of all the workers as they do not
    want to see him and avoid doing so. Lock gives orders to his helper,
    directing him so that he can deliver the orders to the different
    companies of workers. This helper is one that has the birth but has not
    the secret of the true name of God. Lock gives him all the orders in a
    low whisper, and this helper is called Lock-ee.</p>

  <p>As soon as the girl whom they call Normer, has finished, the three
    cross the river to the south side and after landing they all bathe,
    there being a secluded place close by where the girl takes her bath
    and when they have finished they proceed to the Lah-wah-alth or house
    where Lock’s wife and his helper’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span> wife are preparing the only meal
    that they eat every twenty-four hours. After the meal is finished Lock
    and his helper go to the sweat-house for the night in which a fire has
    been started by an old man who was selected to get the wood and thus
    the place was warm for the night. Lock and his helper take a smoke and
    then retire. Very early in the morning there is a fire made in the
    sweat-house and Lock and Lock-nee take a sweat and then go back across
    the river, Lock going to his secluded place and keeping himself hid so
    that none can catch even a glimpse of him. The girl also keeps secluded
    by keeping in the house where the wives of Lock and Lock-nee are, and
    she is busy fixing her dresses, combing her hair and keeping herself
    very neat and what spare time she may have after this she is making a
    new dress or skirt from the inner bark of the wild maple that grows on
    the river. The bark is bleached until white, then platted and hung to
    a band that goes around the waist, making it as a skirt, coming down
    to the ankles. All the workers which are called Nah-quelth are ready
    to work like beavers getting everything in readiness. No one eats more
    than one meal a day and all must be in good health and young before
    they are accepted to work on the fish dam. The day that it starts and
    until it is completed must not exceed ten days. The girl, Normer, now
    sends Lock’s wife or Lock-nee’s wife, (either one can go) to select for
    her ten girls all of which must be of good birth from the middle class
    or rich, and not more than ten, but if ten cannot be secured a less
    number will do. These young girls now come and are called Wah-clure,
    but they do not see Normer. They remain with their kindred and are
    drilled and fixed up to be ready for the last day and final finish of
    the fish dam. Now Lock-nee has selected from the Nah-quelth or workers,
    either five or six to act as managers over the different parts of the
    work, and these take the bark of the madrone and make a hat which
    looks very much like an old style plug hat that the white man wears.
    This is striped and painted in a novel fashion and these workers are
    very noticeable as they go from place to place giving instructions to
    the workers. These plug hat men now select twelve or less boys and
    put them to making ribbons of bark which they stripe off very flowery
    by painting and carving, also making fancy Indian pipes, carving and
    painting them very artistically. These boys are called Charrah<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span> and the
    pipes and ribbons made by them are put on the top of long slim poles
    from twelve to fifteen feet long and are to be used at the finish of
    the fish dam. These poles have the bark taken off and are clean and
    white.</p>

  <p>All this time Lock has kept himself secreted from the eyes of all
    the workers and on the morning of the fifth day, very early, he and
    Lock-nee go up the mountain side and select the first one of the long
    beams or stringers that is to be put in on the north side of the
    river, starting just above the large rock under which he keeps himself
    secluded up to this time, and when he has selected the one that suits
    him he makes a small fire at the roots of the tree and burns his
    incense, then sits down by the fire and prays to God to give blessings
    to the whole people with health and plenty. Now all of the workers
    knowing the time, and the boys and the men have followed up and are
    all looking for the posts, twenty-two in number, and the rest of the
    stringers which are ten besides the one that Lock selects, making
    eleven altogether. After Lock has finished with his prayer to God he
    commences to cut the tree, Lock-nee helping him and together they cut
    it down and when it falls with a crash all the workers shout loudly,
    “oh-oo”, and the whole side of the mountain echoes with their voices.
    Lock-nee begins to trim off the branches and peel the bark while others
    come in and help. All the workers are scattered off in different
    places, each squad looking for posts and the rest looking for stringers
    and cutting them down and as each tree fell they all holler “oh-oo.”
    They take the bark off and trim and sharpen the posts. All these pieces
    are complete in one day and taken down to the river’s edge by evening
    and before any one can eat or drink water after all the pieces are
    finished. Lock and Lock-nee take the lead with the stringers, a rope
    tied around the large butt end which is quite heavy timber and start
    down the mountain with it, Lock all the while talking in prayer to God,
    and if the timber stops he prays and talks good and as he has all his
    life been so good that God causes the timber to move along easily. As
    Lock starts all the rest follow with their timbers and all arrive about
    sunset on the north bank with all the heavy frame part for the fish
    dam. These people while they are working all day are full of jokes,
    laughing and telling funny stories, and if one has done a mean trick
    of any kind and others know of it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span> he is twitted about it; they poke
    fun at each other continually, yet they all keep good natured about it
    and they are all very witty in their answers. They all smoke during the
    day, each one using his own pipe and all have their own buck-skin sack
    to carry his pipe and tobacco in. Now all the timbers are in the water
    and tied to the bank and left floating, ready for morning. Men and boys
    now bathe themselves and clean their hair, when all depart for their
    different camping places, parting with jests and jokes, and eat their
    only meal in twenty-four hours. Lock addresses the girl as my child,
    my daughter and other endearing terms. After the meal is over Lock and
    Lock-nee go to the sweat-house to rest and sleep for the night and in
    the morning, early, all are out and ready and go down to the river and
    across in their canoes, they having many of them on such occasions.
    Lock now gets the rock for driving the post, this is of granite and
    flat, from twelve to fifteen inches across and from two to four inches
    thick and weighs from fifty to sixty pounds. Only those who use this
    rock ever have a chance to examine it and it is said to have been made
    many generations ago. It is kept hidden in a secret place and only
    brought to view for this purpose and all the other tools that are used
    for every part and purpose in putting in the fish dam (La-og-gen) are
    hidden in a secret place, not all being in one place, and there are
    never more than two persons (Lock and Lock-nee) at one time that know
    where to find them, being handed down from one to another. This rock
    they call Milth-me-ah-lisi and in calling for it they say, Say-yah.
    The other tools are called by their different names, the hammer they
    call Tec-wan-ore. Lock and Lock-nee drive the first two posts which
    starts the fish dam, the first one is driven nearly perpendicular, and
    now the workers have to put up a staging which Lock climbs upon as the
    post is long and has to be driven quite deep into the ground. Lock-nee
    holds the post so as to keep it in place while Lock takes a maul and
    as he raises it he talks to God, using words for lots of salmon and
    to bless all, and at this he comes down with a hard blow, and keeps
    it up until the first post has been driven to the proper depth, he
    does not strike his blows fast, each blow is struck slowly. The second
    post is set at an angle on the down river side of the first one, set
    to make a brace against the current of the river, and also the top
    ends come together so as to leave a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span> fork or crotch at the top which
    is tied securely together with hazel rope, leaving it so beam poles
    can be placed in the crotch and tied securely. Now when Lock-nee has
    the second post properly set in place, Lock commences as on the first
    and drives it down to the proper depth and after this is done Lock and
    Lock-nee take the hazel withe and tie it to the first one, leaving
    the crotch. This being done Lock passes the mall over to the other
    workers and drive the rest of the posts, the next two of which are set
    angling down the river and the third two are set angling up the river
    so as to make it in a shape like the old style of a worm fence made of
    rails; this is also done for the purpose of bracing the whole structure
    against the current of the river. As soon as the posts are all driven
    Lock and Lock-nee place the first long stringer in its right place,
    which is on the north side of the river, then the workers soon place
    the rest of them and tie them with hazel withes. Then smaller posts
    are driven at the corners for each trap, at the corners two posts are
    driven, one angling down the river and they are placed so as to leave
    the crotch, in which a pole is placed. The traps are about twelve feet
    wide and fourteen feet long commencing so the center of the first trap
    will be in the center of the first worm of the main frame work and
    this is started first on the north side of the river. When the posts
    are all driven for the traps which are many of them for the corners
    and side and also to brace against the current of the river. The top
    pieces are placed and braced, then poles are withed to the sides and
    ends all around each trap. The mat or woven work of small split poles
    are taken in and placed, unrolled, letting them close up, close to the
    frame work of the structure. These traps are set on the down river
    side of the main structure so that all of this mat work has to be put
    on the inside of the frame work of the traps. Then all of this matting
    is tied with hazel withes very carefully. These traps are not put up
    close together, there is a place of about six feet left between each
    trap so that a canoe can be run between them. This matting is placed
    all the way across on the upper side of the main frame, except on the
    south side of the river where there is an open place of about twenty
    feet in width, this only has the main beam over it and is left so all
    can pass up and down the river in their boats, and also a chance for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
    many salmon to pass up river. They place boards along the main fish
    dam so as to leave a good foot walk all the distance across the river
    from one bank to another. They put in a gate at the lower end of fish
    traps and one at the upper end of each trap, and at this time the water
    begins to roar so that when close to the dam it is deafening. Now there
    are so many families to each trap, so the upper gate is closed down and
    the lower gate is opened. We are now up to the noon hour of the tenth
    day, when there is a long pole some twenty to twenty-four feet long set
    just at the south side and end of the fish dam and just on the lower
    side, on the top of this pole all of the fancy work that the boys have
    been making is tied and there is a mound of sand heaped around the foot
    of this pole to a height of three or four feet and from eight to ten
    feet across. Now it is about four o’clock in the afternoon and Lock
    and Lock-nee are with the Nah-quirlth, busy as bees putting the final
    touches to the fish dam. And of all the tribes, the women are the most
    anxious and are from place to place asking the others how the girl
    Normer is, if she is well, can she go and if she is going, when out
    comes Normer from her place where she has been kept from view all these
    days. She has in the palm of her right hand a small basket in which is
    a small piece of acorn dough, and she goes in a swift run on a broad
    smooth trail in an easterly direction for a distance of five hundred
    yards to this pole, which she runs up to, facing it, then going around
    to the right she sets the basket on top of the mound, close up to the
    pole. All are watching for her and as soon as one sees her they all
    shout at the top of their voices. Then Lock runs to hide as he does not
    want to see her at this time. Now she turns and goes back at the same
    swift speed and at this time all of the girls that she sent for are
    in their place where they dance. The ground is all fixed, having been
    scooped out leaving a depression some four feet deep and twenty feet
    across, gently sloping to the center. Normer comes up to the dancers
    and passes on in a westerly direction down the river until she comes to
    a woman who has been a Normer before her and tells her where to turn to
    the river, where she bathes herself, then turns back and walks to where
    the girls are dancing and sits down in front of them and urges them to
    sing louder and dance faster. These Wa-clures stand erect moving the
    body forward and backward by the action<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span> of the knees, raising first
    one foot and then the other. Normer keeps watch of the sun and as it
    is getting low and it is getting time for all to come, she raises to
    a kneeling position and bids the Wa-clures to sing louder and dance
    faster, they then move very lively. Normer is the absolute ruler of
    her people as she is the child of God’s own purity. Then comes Lock
    with Lock-nee closely behind and thirdly comes the boy, Charrah, with
    the same basket that Normer left at the pole and which is now full of
    water, and as Lock walks up to Normer the girls all drop down and hover
    over Normer, then Lock and Lock-nee drop over them, then the boy who
    has the basket of water lowers his hand and throws the basket, water
    and all as high up in the air as he can and the water comes down over
    them in a shower. As the boy throws the basket and water up in the
    air he and all of the boys drop down over the others, hovering over
    Normer like a swarm of bees hovering over the queen. This is done for
    her protection, for now come all the workers, each one having a long
    pole on the top of which are tied the bark ribbons and fancy carved
    Indian pipes that the boys made, and as they come running up they form
    a half circle around the heap letting the long heavy poles fall over
    them with a crash which is done so quickly that it is very hard to see
    how it is done, and just as quickly the whole heap raises up out of
    this place and place themselves in fours for the next move. At this
    time if Normer was silly enough she could command every man, woman and
    child to lie flat on their abdomens and go without eating for another
    twenty-four hours, as all must obey her commands, no matter what they
    might be. Now the fish dam is completed and all go to their camps.
    Normer goes to the lodge with Lock, while Lock-nee secures and takes
    to her the first salmon taken from the fish dam and Lock-nee cuts out
    from the middle of this salmon enough for her supper, while no one else
    can eat of the salmon until the next day. Every thing now becomes quiet
    for an hour, as they are all taking their evening meal. Then first one
    than another will begin to inquire about Normer and her health. Now all
    depends upon Normer, if she is strong enough she quietly goes out and
    cleans off the ground this same evening but if too tired she puts it
    off until morning. After making her plans she then gives her orders to
    Lock and he in return gives it out to the people and they all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span> begin
    to prepare. After Normer has cleaned the ground she makes a small fire
    just in front of the dancers and on which she places the incense roots,
    then as the dancers come up and take their places she sits there with
    her hair hanging loose, down on each side of her face, and with beads
    over her neck and hanging down over her breast, she has on a white
    buck-skin dress trimmed with beads and shells, all of which are made by
    her own hands as we use only of our own make. She does not use feathers
    of any kind. Normer sits there a model of beauty with the teachings
    that have been hand-down through the many generations, that if she
    should, while carrying out her duties, lose her virtue, or disobey any
    of the laws of her God, that she would be struck dead for doing so.
    Now the dance starts and this is the beginning of the White Deer-skin
    dance. This place is about ten miles up the river from the place where
    the White Deer-skin dance is held but is started first at this place
    after the finishing of the fish dam. Normer starts it here and then
    all go home, but Normer, Lock, Lock-nee, the girls and the boys remain
    here, Lock and Lock-nee taking charge of the fish dam and all stay
    here as long as the fish dam holds intact, except the last day of the
    White Deer-skin dance when Lock calls all of them and asks if they want
    to see it the last day, if they decide to go not one of them must eat
    the last day and all go together and return in the evening when they
    all eat. Now all is fun and mirth with all of them that remain at the
    fish dam, Lock and Lock-nee leading them all in the plays and fun of
    every nature. Normer stays with Lock and Lock-nee but she now goes out
    and plays and jokes and has her share of the fun, and all have their
    regular meals. This place where the fish dam is put in is called by
    them Cap-pell and is a bar of some twenty or thirty acres, high enough
    so the river never over-flows it and yet it is very level. It is a
    pretty place, being situated on the south bank of the Klamath river.
    There are two villages on this pretty spot, one being Cap-pell which
    was very large in the ages gone by and which contained a very large
    number of Indians. The other village was called Sy-ah and was very
    ancient, being the place where the lodge was situated. The house they
    stay in is called Lah-wa-alth and the house where Lock and Lock-nee
    sleep is called Ur-girk.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span></p>

  <p>I will say to the white race that my people, or any other Indian tribes
    as far as I know them, do not use the name of our Creator when using
    profane language, as we would feel it a disgrace to do so, even to
    think of such a thing. We never use the sacred name of God, only in our
    prayers.</p>

  <p>The following are a few expressions sometimes used: Kee-mol-len-a
    Ta-ga-ar-a-wah-ma, (bad talk) pointing the right hand, with the fingers
    extended, toward a person and at the same time saying: Woo-saw-ah,
    means that the person is badly born, and they never forgive you for
    this. Another is: Char-reck-quick-cal-lah, and means: “I wish you were
    in hell”, and for this also they never forgive.</p>

  <p>Gazing down from His Throne on high, Wah-pec-wah-mow saw the world he
    had created was a desolate waste without human life, or life of any
    kind. He now began the transformation of the new world, and lo, the
    once barren surface of the earth was clothed in verdure; forests lifted
    their giant branches sky-ward; tranquil streams flowed and great rivers
    wended their way to the ocean.</p>

  <p>The first living thing placed upon the earth was the white deer
    (Moon-chay-poke). The white deer roamed over the hills, mountains,
    in the valleys and on the plains. He was the pride and dignity of
    the animal kingdom. This is why the Klamath Indians revere the white
    deer that is so sacred to their hearts and use the skin as an emblem
    of purity, in one of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span> greatest festivals, or worships, which
    is termed in English as, “The White Deer-skin Dance.” In the Indian
    language it is called, “Oh-pure-ah-wah”; which does not mean dance but
    means one of their most sacred religious festivals.</p>

  <p>The next living creature that Wah-pec-wah-mow placed upon the earth was
    the red eagle, Hay-wan-alth, who has ever since ruled as the monarch of
    the skies. The Indians prize the feathers of this eagle very highly,
    and use them in their great festival. In the decoration of their
    head-gear, they take a single feather, fasten it in the hair at the
    back of the head, arranging it so that it stands straight up. They also
    use the feathers of the bald eagle, Per-gone-gish, and the gray eagle,
    Per-gish, sometimes as a substitute for the feathers of the red eagle.</p>

  <p>After the white deer and red eagle was placed upon the earth,
    Wah-pec-wah-mow now created all the other animals of the earth. Some
    were to roam upon the plains, others in the forests, some to eat grass
    and others to devour other animals, etc.</p>

  <p>Wah-pec-wah-mow did not give our people any single day during the
    week or month, as a day of worship, but gave them a certain season
    of the year in which to hold their religious ceremonies. This season
    of worshipful ceremonies usually begins in the month of September,
    and lasts for several days. It is the season of the year when the
    water of the rivers and brooks ebb lowest, and the summer is almost
    ready to wane into the glories of Autumn. This season is called,
    “Kne-wal-la-taw,” the eighth month of the year, according to our way of
    reckoning time.</p>

  <p>When Wah-pec-wah-mow had finished creating the plant and animal life of
    the earth, He then created the first real man. He made the first man
    of the soil of the earth, and placed him in the beautiful valley of
    Cheek-cheek-alth. This valley was located in a far off northern clime.
    When the first man was created and he became a living being upon the
    earth, Wah-pec-wah-mow said to him, “You are a living man.” God named
    this man He-quan-neck. Inspired with the breath of life, He-quan-neck
    first saw the light of day in this sweet valley of sunshine, flowers,
    fruits and herbs. Among the growing herbs was the herb walth-pay,
    which has a forked root. God saw that the man was lonely in this
    sunny<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span> valley, and he was not pleased with his work. Wah-pec-wah-mow
    now requested He-quan-neck to blow his nose, which he did, and
    immediately the forked root, or walth-pay turned into a living woman,
    Kay-y-yourn-nak. Man now became blessed with a living companion and for
    a time they dwelt together in the chaste life of peace and happiness.</p>

  <p>Our tradition has been handed down through the long centuries, the
    first dwelling place of man and woman was far away in a northern clime.
    It would seem a distant land across the waters from the North American
    continent that is located in the northern part of the world, which we
    call Cheek-cheek-alth.</p>

  <p>Man and woman in the valley of Cheek-cheek-alth knew no sin, two pure
    souls were they in this valley of perpetual sunshine and flowers.</p>

  <p>The loneliness of two human beings dawned upon Wah-pec-wah-mow so
    he decided to have the earth populated with people. He now caused
    He-quan-neck and Kay-y-yourn-nah to fall asleep, and while they slept
    He caused the snake to crawl across the woman’s bare abdomen, that
    awakened the sleepers, and this opened their eyes to their nudeness and
    thereafter they knew sin. The finer senses of the woman awoke, as she
    became deeply humiliated at the sight of her naked self, and she began
    to fasten leaves together from the herb, Cur-poo-sa-gon, out of which
    she made an apron to clothe herself. Thus the first garment that woman
    wore was from the leaves of this wonderful plant. This plant grows in
    abundance along the lower Klamath river and its surrounding regions,
    and the little Indian girls up to this day like to gather these leaves,
    rub their face and hands with and wear them upon their heads under
    their caps. These leaves have a very strong and unpleasant odor.</p>

  <p>Wah-pec-wah-mow commanded the man and woman to go forth and bring
    children upon the earth. A curse fell upon the woman, that she should
    bear children with pain, therefore every woman after her, through all
    the long centuries has had to endure this hardship. The first children
    were born some with light hair and fair skin and blue eyes, and some
    with black hair, dark skin and black eyes and as they married they
    would mate with black hair, the others with light hair and when they
    left the old land Cheek-cheek-alth they were not so dark, many of them
    were light haired, fair and blue eyed.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span></p>

  <p>Wah-pec-wah-mow put a curse upon the snake that it should crawl upon
    its belly as long as the earth should last.</p>

  <p>God’s laws were that every man and woman should marry and bring forth
    children. These people were taught to obey the laws and be honest.
    They increased in number until they became very numerous, and at that
    time, they all talked the same language. As time sped by they became
    very numerous and Wah-pec-wah-mow now caused our people, the Indians,
    to start on their long journey, away from their native haunts and
    childhood’s land, Cheek-cheek-alth. We do not know how long, but they
    wandered thus in search of a new land, leaving behind them only a
    memory of the old land. A land that claims its own no more in life and
    like a people in exile they wandered on.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="subhead">THE WANDERING TRIBE.</div>

  <p class="drop-cap">FROM the land of Cheek-cheek-alth, the mystic Eden of long ago, came
    our wandering tribe of people who long since inhabited North and South
    America; for we are all one people. Among them were our leaders, the
    men who possessed in their secret breasts the true name of God. These
    men and women in our language we call Talth, and were the High Priests,
    and great rulers who ruled our people. Therefore, we were one of the
    tribes that was never ruled by a single chief, but by our Talth, or
    High Priests. Upon leaving the old land the Talth carried with them the
    forked root, Walth-pay, (the root from which woman was made) and the
    stalk of this root as a divine rod of strength, endurance and courage,
    being used as a saviour of the tribe. With it the Talth would command
    food for their famished members and bring peace and rest to their weary
    bodies. The Walth-pay stalk kept perfectly green, and blossomed all the
    while, and the High Priests carried it with them on their long journeys
    and years of wanderings.</p>

  <p>In my infancy, I was taught all that was good, and to make for a true
    and noble womanhood; that there was a God in Heaven who ruled over all,
    and during my researches throughout I have found nothing better. When
    these last two members finish their earthly reign, with us perishes the
    true name of God to my people. With it has perished from the earth our
    true<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span> Indian laws, our sublime religion, our deeds of chivalry, as rich
    as the civilized world has ever beheld. Also our glorious manhood and
    womanhood; immoral, corrupt, tottering, down-trodden and debauched by a
    superior race, we have perished in that winter night of the transition
    period. At a single blow our laws were torn asunder; loathsome diseases
    we had never known crushed out the life and beauty of our physical
    bodies, and demented our spiritual minds with lowly passions. Poisonous
    spiritous drink has set the brain on fire, degrading man and womanhood,
    thus as a race we have perished. And this great land, the richest the
    world has ever known, the land of our forefathers for so many thousands
    of years. Now another race is struggling on where our reign has ended.
    Already our great rulers are at rest, and forever; laureled with the
    glories of the primeval ages that have passed away in silence. As a
    nation, like the ancient Egyptians, we have grown old and passed away;
    we have seen a great civilization rise to the highest of its splendors
    and pass away to another land beyond recall. Today we see another
    civilization endowed with a splendor of its own, rising over the debris
    of the eternal years.</p>

  <p>We are all one tribe from the source of the Klamath river to its mouth,
    and down the coast as far as Trinidad, (Cho-ri) and up the coast as far
    as Wilson creek, which we call Ah-man. We are classed in two divisions
    and term ourselves as Po-lick-las along the coast and up the river
    as far as Weitchpec, designated as the lower division of our tribe.
    From Weitchpec on up the river to its source we term as Petch-ic-la,
    the upper division of our tribe. We intermarry to a great extent,
    having the same marriage laws and religious ceremonies and all our
    traditions and teachings are the same. We call God, Wah-pec-wah-mow,
    which means in our tongue the father of all and we do not consider Him
    as one “which has been so much of the white man’s allegory, but as an
    Invisible Omnipotent Being, who rules this great universe with an all
    seeing eye, He is everywhere.”</p>

  <p>Wah-pec-wah-mow is the common name applied to God, used by all classes
    of our tribe, as the real and true name of God is never spoken. Our
    high priests, born of the royal marriages, are initiated in the Holy
    Lodge and are given the true name of God, but they never speak it
    outside of the lodge, it is only spoken inside after they have gone
    through a long and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span> secret communion, and then the name is only
    whispered in the lowest whisper from mouth to ear. This true name is
    only used by the Talth with profound reverence to the Great Creator,
    in the sacred lodge and in the hallowed lonely places far back on the
    high mountains where they go to worship in the profound solitudes, away
    from the gaze of curious people. Our religion has been too sacred,
    too sublime an ideal to quarrel over, hence we have remained silent
    through the gloom of so many years and borne patiently the insults on
    royal society as being heathens. This true name of God, as great as the
    universe, will never be spoken again. If it should be uttered in a loud
    and harsh tone of voice, it is said that the earth will tremble, ignite
    in mighty flames and pass away forever. Ever thus, since the creation
    of the world, the Talth have handed down our religion and traditions
    from the old land of Cheek-cheek-alth, from generation to generation.
    It is the duty of every Indian child to be pious and worship the Great
    Creator. Our sacred religion is O-pure-ah-way (the White Deer-skin
    dance) where all the members of the tribes in unison and worship, and
    entertain our guests with much hospitality.</p>

  <p>In our recollections of the past we left the land of our birth
    (Cheek-cheek-alth) many thousands of years ago with our leaders, the
    Talth, who were given the true name of God in the old land, and carried
    with them the forked root, or Walth-pay. With this divine rod they
    commanded food, comfort and peace during their long years of weary
    wanderings. After we left the beautiful valley of Cheek-cheek-alth, for
    years we wandered down a European land, always moving toward the south,
    having our origin in the far north. Over this land we wandered like
    exiles, we know not how long, as it might have been centuries until we
    reached the rolling waves of the ocean. Upon reaching this salt water
    we made boats or canoes, and paddled over the waves until we reached
    the opposite shore, having crossed the straits in safety. Having
    reached this opposite shore, upon this new continent we continued our
    weary years of wandering, ever on, far on, down this land, always going
    south as before. We carried the memory through the long ages, the
    perils of the far north, the huge icebergs, the regal monarchs of the
    North that floated like ghost-ships at night on dream-land seas, the
    splendors of the aurora borealis flickered across the snowy fields and
    through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span> this land of the midnight sun came our brave forefathers.
    In this land of the frozen North some of our people were left, the
    Esquimau; they were given a language as they were separated from our
    sturdy band and emigrated over the snowy fields and have long since
    from this time on inhabited the land of perpetual ice and snow.</p>

  <p>Our tribe would often become weary with travel and become very
    dissatisfied and would quarrel much among themselves. The Talth would
    stop after hearing so much grumbling and build a lodge where their
    members would hold a meeting and offer up worship to God, that He would
    guide them aright, endow them with power to bring peace among their
    people, comfort them in their wants and give them food. After the lodge
    meeting and prayer the Talth would command with the rod of Walth-pay
    food for their people. The food came to them in the form of acorn dough
    out of which they made bread or pop-saw. The Indians would never see
    pop-saw falling to the ground, but they would find it where the Talth
    told them to look, and each one would be compelled to gather up their
    own, or they would go hungry. As long as they remained camped in the
    same place the pop-saw would come to them but when they would break
    up camp and travel on the pop-saw would cease to come and the tribe
    would grow very hungry and begin to quarrel again. The Talth would
    stop after days of fatigue and hunger, and build another lodge where
    their members would worship at the sacred shrine. After the worship
    food would come again in the form of the acorn dough, commanded with
    rod of Walth-pay. Sometimes the Talth would leave the camps for several
    days, during which time the people would become very restless and
    discontented and some of the people would try to perform the duties
    of the Talth in their absence, and some of them would pray to the
    sun, some to the stars and other idols. The Talth would be very much
    humiliated upon their return to find their people so corrupt in their
    worship, and it would take much faithful work to assure peace and order
    among them again. The Talth would plant the herb, Walth-pay at their
    stopping places during their travels, and it would readily take root
    and grow, at almost every stopping place some of our people were left
    and God would give them a language; they would inhabit the locality
    permanently and branch out to other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span> localities, while our part of the
    people traveled on until they reached their final earthly home on the
    Klamath river, which we call Health-kick-wer-roy, and here we found the
    white race, (Wa-gas) which will be told of in another chapter. Thus
    we traveled on down a great continent, leaving behind at our stopping
    places, a portion of our people, which were given different languages.
    Thus were our languages confounded among the tribes of America, and our
    tribes became numerous, being scattered over the land of the midnight
    sun of perpetual ice and snow, over the continent of North America to
    the equator and regions of perpetual sunshine; and beyond the equator
    over the continent of South America to its farthermost southern
    borders, where we merge into the regions of ice and snow again, our
    tribes have been scattered. Over this great land we are all one people,
    however some of our tribes were far superior to others. We know not how
    many centuries we wandered, or when we reached our last stopping place
    on the Klamath river and where we decided our long journey should end,
    and that we would make this our final home. The Wah-teck, Wah-ker-rah,
    Cor-tep and Pec-wan villages were among our first camping grounds on
    the Klamath river. Here we spread our camps and built our first houses
    long ages ago, and have resided in them and kept them in repair from
    generation to generation. Some of these primeval houses yet remain
    in these old villages, haunted with the romance of centuries and the
    inspiring history of past ages. Upon our first arrival there were a
    great many of our people and we began to divide off into different
    villages and locate along the Klamath river and down the coast as far
    as Trinidad, (Cho-ri) and up the coast to Wilson Creek (Ah-man). The
    other tribes were placed by Wah-pec-wah-mow in different localities,
    that all the people might sustain themselves with plenty of game and
    food, and be kept comfortable.</p>

  <p>The Talth kept the Walth-pay in commemoration of God’s creation of
    woman and their travels, and planted it in a few selected places
    back in the lonely mountains. The Talth all know where to find this
    wonderful herb growing, but it is also fading with the remote ages as
    there are only a few Indians left who know where to find it. With them
    passes away the sacred rites and laws of an ancient nation forever, and
    the primeval art becomes a thing of the mystic ages.</p>

  <div class="subhead">TRADITIONS OF THE ANCIENT WHITE PEOPLE.</div>

  <p class="drop-cap">WHEN the Indians first made their appearance on the Klamath river it
    was already inhabited by a white race of people known among us as the
    Wa-gas. These white people were found to inhabit the whole continent,
    and were a highly moral and civilized race. They heartily welcomed the
    Indians to their country and taught us all of their arts and sciences.
    The Indians recognized the rights of these ancient people as the first
    possessors of the soil and no difficulties ever arose between the two
    people. Their hospitality was exceedingly generous in the welfare of
    our people and all prospered together in peace and happiness, in their
    pursuit of human existence. After a time there were inter-marriages
    between the two races, but these were never promiscuous. For a vast
    period of time the two races dwelt together in peace and honored homes,
    wars and quarrels were unknown in this golden age of happiness. No
    depredations were ever committed upon the property of their people, as
    the white people ruled with beacon light of kindness, and our people
    still worship the hallowed places where once they trod. Their morals
    were far superior to the white people of today, their ideals were high
    and inspired our people with greatness. After we had lived with these
    ancient people so long, they suddenly called their hosts together and
    mysteriously disappeared for a distant land, we know not where. We have
    no memory of their reason or cause why they abandoned their ancient
    homes where they had dwelt for untold centuries. Wars did not drive
    them forth, for we loved them more than brothers, and difficulties
    were unknown between the two people. On leaving they went toward the
    North from whence we came, and disappeared from our land beyond the
    northern seas. It was a sad farewell when they departed from this
    land, for our people mourned their loss, as no more have we found such
    friends as they, so true and loyal. In their farewell journey across
    this land they left land-marks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span> of stone monuments, on the tops of high
    mountains and places commanding a view of the surrounding country.
    These land-marks we have kept in repair, down through the ages in
    loving remembrance. I have seen many of these land-marks myself (and
    often repaired them) that they left as a symbol of the mystic ages and
    the grandeur of a mighty nation that passed in a single season. Oh, how
    little we know of the depths of the ages gone, how wide, how profound
    and deep is the knowledge we seek; a monument of stone, a stone bowl,
    a broken symbol, a hallowed unknown spot, a lodge of ruins, all this
    makes a golden page glittering with diamonds that trills the emotions
    with mysterious longings for truth and light in the depths unknown.</p>

  <p>When the Wag-as left this land they assured my people that they would
    return to them at some future time. Perchance thousands of years
    have elapsed since then, and they have not returned, we have waited
    in vain for it seems that our cherished hopes are fading. However,
    some of our people are still looking for the return of the white
    man. The traditions handed down lead us to believe that the Wa-gas
    returned to the land of their birth, in the far north, the valley of
    Cheek-cheek-alth, as their traditions were given to us that their
    origin was in this same land of Cheek-cheek-alth, as they came down
    from the North when they came to this land. When the Wa-gas first
    arrived on this continent they handed down the traditions to us that
    it was inhabited by a giant race of people when they first came.
    These giants were represented by the Wa-gas as being very swarthy in
    complexion, and they used implements so large that no ordinary man
    could lift them. It was an age when large animals roamed the earth, and
    it seems the birds and fowls were all very large in size. It appeared
    to be the first age, and was the age of the giants. The recollections
    transmitted by the Wa-gas were that these giants were very cruel and
    wicked. It was said that God became displeased with them and destroyed
    them and they all perished from the earth. It was also said that God
    appeared to the High Priest of the Wa-gas and told them that he was
    going to destroy the giant race and that the Wa-gas themselves would
    survive upon the earth as a new people. Smaller birds and animals
    would appear upon the earth for the use of man, thus the age of giants
    perished, but the Wa-gas do not hand down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span> any tradition of how they
    perished from the earth, as my people have no recollections of ever
    seeing giants. My mother says that our people in ancient times have
    seen many relics belonging to these prehistoric giants, such as huge
    stone bowls, stone slabs and other implements so great that our people
    could not move them. During the ages of rains and wearing away of the
    earth, these implements have been buried so deep and have sunk into the
    earth, that is the reason we cannot find them today. The Indian name for the
    giant race is Pah-pel-ene, which means people that have all died and
    passed away.</p>

  <p>When the Wa-gas returned to Cheek-cheek-alth it is supposed they found
    a ladder in this beautiful valley which extends from earth to Heaven,
    and climbed it to Werse-on-now, (Heaven) where they dwell with God. All
    the half castes with the exception of a few went away with the Wa-gas,
    and nearly all those that were three quarters Indian remained with our
    people. This is said to be the reason why some of our people are very
    fair. Some of the Indians are still looking for their return to the
    earth, when they come back it is believed that peace and happiness will
    reign supreme again over this great land and all evil will be cast out.
    When the present race of the white people made their first appearance
    upon the American continent, we believed it was the Wa-gas returning
    and a hearty welcome was extended to them and there was great rejoicing
    among our tribes. But soon the sad mistake was discovered to our
    sorrow, when the men began to debauch our women, give whiskey to our
    men and claim our land that our forefathers had inhabited for so many
    thousands of years, yet not a single family has ever been driven from
    their house on the Klamath river up to this day. We no longer termed
    them as Wa-gas, but as Ken-e-yahs, which means foreigners, who had no
    right to the land and could never appreciate our kindness, for they
    were a very different people from the Wa-gas. They had corrupt morals
    that brought dissolution upon our people and wrought the horrors of
    untold havoc.</p>

  <p>When the Indians first reached the Klamath river there were large
    prairies and vast tracts of grassy land, which have since grown up
    in timber and under-brush. Many of the prairies were set on fire and
    burnt off every year during the dry seasons which kept the timber from
    growing up very fast.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span></p>

  <p>The Klamath emptied into the ocean at Wilson creek, about six miles
    north of where it now goes into and ocean at Reck-woy. There were
    high bluffs of rocks between the river and the ocean all the way from
    Reck-woy to Wilson creek, which kept the river in its course to Ah-man
    (Wilson creek) where it emptied into the ocean. The river was said to
    have kept in this course until our Christ caused the mighty rocks to
    split open and the waters of the river rushed ahead to the ocean at
    Reck-woy, where it has ever since flowed into the ocean.</p>

  <p>The traditions handed down say that the land, north of Redwood creek,
    where it goes into the ocean, extended far out into the sea to the
    large rock that is now known to the white people as Redding rock, has
    continually washed away leaving this rock jutting up from the ocean
    depths and can be seen for many miles over the surrounding area of land
    and sea. This rock is located at a distance of about ten miles from the
    shore and is called by the Indians Sa-quan-ow. This name translated
    into English means an acorn pestle, a conical shaped stone, carved
    out of granite and is used to pound acorns and grass seeds into the
    finest flour. Long ages ago Redding rock extended up from the ocean to
    a great height, and from a distance appeared to be a huge Sa-quan, or
    pestle, hence its name. After ages of erosion the massive rock became
    surrounded by water and the receding bluffs left it alone out in the
    ocean where its greater portion has crumbled and fallen beneath the
    waves as it is seen today. The Indians still call it Sa-quan-ow.</p>

  <p>There has been but little change in the channel of the Klamath river,
    except at its mouth since our arrival in this land. In olden times
    the channel of the river was very deep and clear and much narrower
    than it is now and large bars of alluvial soil composed its banks,
    where luxuriant grasses grew, and upon these lowlands during the
    winter months great herds of deer and elk would graze, coming down
    from the snow covered mountains. The channels of the large creeks
    and tributaries of the river, such as Blue creek, (Ur-ner) Tec-tah
    and Pec-wan have practically never changed as they still flow into
    the river in the same places. Where the Trinity river flows into the
    Klamath river it has made but little or no change during the passing
    ages as has been handed down to us.</p>

  <p>We have no word of severe earthquakes in our regions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span> but have had
    slight shocks from time to time throughout the centuries. We have no
    tales of any great damage ever done by earthquakes and our people
    never held any fear of tremors of the earth. But my people tell of
    great tidal waves that have swept our country. They say a long time
    ago one swept up the Klamath river to the mouth of the Trinity river,
    a distance of over forty miles, and did great damage, as it swept away
    houses and thousands of our people were drowned and carried away by the
    rolling waves of the ocean, so few of our tribe were left that they
    were well nigh exterminated. Many smaller tidal waves have swept over
    the coast where the destruction was not so great.</p>

  <p>They tell of epidemics that came up the river and laid us low in the
    devastation of life, thousands of our people would pass away in a
    single season; they would die so fast that they could not be buried
    and many of the bodies would be thrown into the river. The only way we
    could keep the whole tribe from complete devastation by the ravages of
    these dreadful diseases was to abandon the dead and leave the river
    and go back into the high mountains and there we built bark houses
    and remain until the snow and cold would compel us to retreat to the
    lowlands again. In our mountain home we subsisted on wild game,
    berries, pine nuts, roots and herbs. Some of our people would have such
    a terror of the fatal diseases that they would refuse to return to
    their homes and would brave the fierce storms of the cold winter until
    they were convinced that all dangers had ceased. In our traditions of
    the passing centuries many of these epidemics have almost devastated
    the land of human life. During one of these contagions it was said that
    the children would go down to the river to swim and would lie down in
    rows from six to twelve in number upon the sand, as if they were alive
    and had been placed there by careful hands; but they would be in their
    eternal sleep, contagion having overtaken them.</p>

  <p>We lose time in our count each year, so we throw in or stop counting
    until the time comes around to start again. The Klamath Indians are
    good in counting and can count up into the thousands. We count ten, and
    ten hundreds for one thousand. All of our counting is done by whole numbers;
    we have no fractions. All the women have to count and count closely
    in weaving baskets in order to make the designs come out correctly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
    We have astronomers, called Haw-getch-neens, and they keep close
    observation of the sun, which we call Ca-chine-wan-now-slay. Day we
    call Ca-chine; the moon, Nas-cha-wan-now-sloy, this means the night sun.</p>

    <h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI.</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="subhead">DEATH AND THE SPIRIT LAND.</div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THERE is a large and silent river that flows through the shadowy vale
    of death. On the banks of this awful and mysterious river dwells an
    old woman, called Sye-elth, and she keeps at her side a large dog,
    Chish-yah, (the common name for dog).</p>

  <p>When an Indian dies, if he has led a dishonorable and wicked life, a
    broad path leads his soul down to the banks of the river to the very
    door where the old woman lives in her house. When the wandering soul
    reaches her door, the Chish-yah tries to drive it back to the dead
    body, but the old woman fights the dog off and if she is successful in
    her efforts she takes charge of the miserable soul and sends it on to
    the opposite side of the river, in the shadowy land of endless anguish.
    If the dog is successful in fighting the soul back it returns to the
    dead body where life is regained and the person lives again. This
    seldom occurs, and only where the body lives in a state of coma and is
    supposed to be dead, but after a few hours comes out of that state and
    revives into life again. The Chish-yah is seldom successful, as a case
    rarely occurs. This is why the Indian never likes to scold or treat the
    dog badly.</p>

  <p>The old Indians do not like to look at a photograph or to have their
    photographs taken, because they say it is a reflection or a shadowy
    image of the departed spirit, O-quirlth. They do not like to see
    spirits, but they say they have often seen them. This is the reason
    they turn their backs on the camera and object so strongly to having
    their pictures taken. Often have my people been ridiculed for their
    strange actions, but they have a reason for every one of them. If the
    civilized man could only respect the reasons and simple ways of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
    highest type of primitive man, as much as primitive man venerates his
    civilization.</p>

  <p>When the spirit comes back to the tired and weary body, and that body
    lives again, that person is said to meet a very unfortunate existence.
    It is said he is never satisfied with earthly things again. He is very
    restless and unhappy as nothing can satisfy his longing soul, and
    always meets death suddenly.</p>

  <p>On the shore of this mysterious River of Death awaits a young man,
    Pa-ga-rick, in his canoe; he is always ready to receive the soul from
    the old woman as she hands it into his care. His canoe is similar in
    shape and size to the earthly Indian canoes, with the exception that if
    one may note carefully that all the canoes contain in the bow a knob in
    the center, some three feet back from the bow, which is the heart, and
    they say it is the life of the boat. Also the canoe the Indians use is
    burned inside and out, and polished smooth. The canoe that Pa-ga-rick
    uses for the crossing of the souls is neither burned or polished and
    has no heart, therefore it is called the dead boat, merm-ma. In olden
    times no Indian would venture out in a boat upon the water that did not
    contain a heart, as they said it was lifeless and would be sure to sink
    or some disaster befall it. We call our canoe here on earth, Yatch.</p>

  <p>Sye-elth [TN: lives?] just on the bank of this dark River of Death,
    Char-reck-quick-werroy, where she gets the souls away from the dog.
    She takes it to the water’s edge and gives it to the man in the dead
    boat. He takes the soul into his canoe, paddles it across those
    silent waters, the awful stillness, the awful fear of death. When
    the canoe, Merm-mo or Nee-girk, either name, touches the opposite
    shore, Po-ga-rick, takes the soul, o-quirlth, and banishes it into
    exile, exile without an end or example in story, and leaves it in a
    wilderness. In this wilderness it is damp, a constant gloom is cast,
    dark and fearful clouds forever flit, cold winds forever howl and
    shriek the agonies of hell.</p>

  <p>In this terrible wildness, the souls of the condemned men and women
    sustain their misery up on bitter berries, bitter grasses and roots,
    and cannot die. They had never lived but a wasted life upon earth,
    therefore they can wait to die, as souls never die. These wretched
    souls since Time began, and I think the time is sad and heavy through
    all the weary ages, since they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span> go wandering, hallowing, moaning,
    weeping and wailing, grieving grief without an end and suffering pain,
    intense pain that knows no ending. Thus, Wah-pec-wah-mow, the Great God
    has seen fit to punish his disreputable children until the judgment day.</p>

  <p>Sye-elth, this old woman, is the satan of my people, Chish-yah, the
    dog, is our Guardian Angel. This old woman is our evil doer who is
    always trying to influence the Indians away from the path of rectitude.
    She hovers about them in life unseen, seeking out their weak points,
    that she may lead them evil ways and vindicate her cruel wants upon
    their death by taking their souls down the broad path to the wilderness
    of anguish. Fearing her powers, fearing the Unhappy Land, the Indians
    struggle to live simple and peaceful lives and never quarrel over their
    religion.</p>

  <p>The wretched souls banished into the wilderness of anguish do not
    quarrel with one another, as they are too wretched in their own agony
    to concern themselves about others.</p>

  <p>The Indian seeing a vision of the unhappy land tries to live the simple
    and honest life, near to nature, and their nature’s God. However, there
    is not a tribe however well guarded but some and sometimes many stray
    afar from the path of rectitude and are lead into the wilderness of
    anguish by their cruel Satan, Sye-elth.</p>

  <p>My people believe that there will sometime come a chance for them to
    become regenerated, or reborn, so that many of them will be given the
    opportunity to recompensate for the wickedness of their former lives
    and given a chance to live good clean lives in their second birth. Thus
    given the opportunity by God when they die again, they will be rewarded
    in going to Heaven, Werse-on-now. However, if the ones given the
    opportunity of being saved, do not live lives of integrity after their
    second birth, they are cast off and destroyed forever.</p>

  <p>The Indians who had always lived the life of integrity on earth when
    they die their soul or spirit travels a narrow and winding trail which
    takes the soul to north, to a land far away from their native haunts.
    This far northern clime is said to be the old land of Cheek-cheek-alth,
    where the spirit finds a ladder that reaches from earth into Heaven. As
    the spirit climbs the ladder to Heaven it reaches God on that infinite
    shore where it dwells forever in flowery fields of light, straying
    together with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span> the Master in peace and love, and joining the spirits of
    those that have gone before them.</p>

  <p>Can you of the Christian faith comprehend why we take so kindly to your
    own belief? Yet we think that ours is the most perfect and yet you call
    us savage. We love our God almost akin to sadness and are always ready
    with a prayer-offering, be it midday hour or in the hours of the silent
    night. The Indian in all his savagery, could never blaspheme the sacred
    name of his Creator in man’s builded houses, or in his daily life as
    he is a child of nature, akin to nature’s God, that the Divine Being
    is the beacon light of his soul, showing him life beyond the grave and
    into the flowery fields of light and love, on that infinite shore, into
    the glories of Heaven.</p>

  <p>The Indian through his long centuries of barbarism battled with the
    environments of barbaric man. In his child-like nature he taught his
    sons and daughters to be kind, courageous, self-denying, industrious
    and above all have integrity that could not be questioned. Fathers,
    brothers and cousins guarded the mothers, daughters and sisters, that
    not one of them may stray into a life of shame by the passions of
    designing men. Woman was manifestly the upholder of her race, loved
    as the unassuming creature, who gave to the race clean limbed and
    vigorous men. But ah, the sad knell, the approach of civilized man,
    and his crushing hand of debauchery to the sorrow of our race, and our
    laws have long since been demolished, and with it our true religion,
    our life blood, our all. Out of the gloom of saddened years, rising in
    scattered remnants, who like the children of Israel that have lived
    without a country for many weary centuries, we are struggling to gain
    our own once more. Freedom to worship God in our own way and to be
    allowed to become citizens of this our own glorious country.</p>

  <p>When a illegitimate child was born, mother and child lived in disgrace
    and after death could never reach the kingdom of Heaven, but traveled
    that broad road which leads to the wilderness, being forever lost.
    During their life the mother is always addressed as Caw-haw, a name
    that reminds her always of her disgrace every time she is spoken to,
    and the child is always reminded of its unwedded mother. Sometimes the
    unfortunate mother may marry, but she is always known as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span> Caw-haw as
    long as she lives and can not take the name of the man she marries.</p>

  <p>Those who sought unscrupulous brawls were low and disgraced, all
    traveled after death the broad road to Satan and are never given an
    opportunity to go to Werse-on-now. There are many of the miserable
    souls who lived a wasted life on earth, only to enter in the Spirit
    Land, the wilderness of anguish.</p>

  <p>In marriage the wife takes the husband’s name and the husband takes
    the wife’s name, just as an exchange of names and the family names are
    handed down from one generation to another. This is done by giving the
    name to a daughter, son, cousin, etc., either the mother or father’s
    name on both sides of the family. Sometimes the generation dies out
    and there are none left of a near kindred, in this case they sometimes
    give the name to a close friend and this custom is followed more by the
    high families. As an example, some years ago an old man lived in the
    Pec-wan village, his name was Ta-poo-sen. He died some thirty years
    ago, and at this writing a middle aged man is living in the Cor-tep
    village who adopted his name after his death, and he is known to every
    one as Ta-poo-sen. There are quite a number of Indians living at the
    present time who have taken the names of deceased relatives or friends.
    The deceased has been laid at rest for at least one year before any one
    takes his or her name.</p>

  <p>The Klamath Indians are very much prejudiced against one taking their
    own life. They look down on the act, and if one should take his own
    life, which we call o-motch-ser-mer-yer, there is no chance for them to
    be saved and they go down the broad road that leads to the old woman
    and she gives them over to the man in the boat and he takes them over
    and leaves them in the wilderness where they live in misery until the
    judgement day and then are destroyed forever, there being no salvation
    for them and the family will be looked down upon for many generations
    to come and held back in taking part in any of their social functions.
    The children will be shunned by their playmates. The Indian seldom
    commits suicide and will avoid self-destruction by wishing that some
    wild animal will take them while they sleep, and of such cases they
    tell some very weird and touching tales. There was a girl taken by a
    wild animal of which reference is made in another chapter. Another was
    a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span> young man of good family belonging to the Pec-wan village and he
    wanted to marry a girl of the upper division. The young woman refused
    him and this nearly broke his heart, so he went back into the mountains
    all alone and there he busied himself by trapping and hunting until
    he had accumulated great riches of valuable furs and other things
    and was there for a number of years when he returned to his home. He
    never married and lived to be an old man and all the children called
    him grandpa. As he became old he also became blind but the children
    all loved him and any of them were always ready to lead him wherever
    he wanted to go, and he was always ready to give blessings to the
    newly married couples and to newly born babies. He always wanted to
    visit where there was a new born baby. This old man would sweep and
    keep clean the village, even down to the creek and river, feeling and
    sweeping the whole day long and when he was tired some of the children
    would lead him home, and he thus lived to a good old age. So this is
    the way it would go in accordance with their belief in the hereafter.
    A Klamath Indian would never commit suicide if there was any way to
    prevent it on account of the stigma it would place on the family.</p>

  <p>The Klamath Indian grave is made about two and a half feet deep. They
    take redwood or Douglas spruce boards which they place in the oblong
    square as they never nail or fasten the boards together. Placing one
    wide board in the bottom and boards on each side with short ones fitted
    in across the ends, the coffin is made ready to receive the corpse.</p>

  <p>At the time of death the body is washed with the branches of the
    wormwood dipped into a basket of water and brushed over the entire
    body, never allowing their hands to touch the body at any time if it
    can be avoided. After the body has been bathed in this manner it is
    clothed in the regular clothing and laid out for burial, wrapped in a
    blanket and placed on a wide plank where it is left for twenty-four
    hours. After it has been laid out friends and relatives gather around
    it in prayer, and the director of the funeral is given a large bunch
    of flag grasses, which he takes in his hand and holds over the blaze
    of the fire to ignite and with flaming grasses he stands over the
    body waving it back and forth sprinkling the falling ashes over the
    body.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span> This is the final blessing given with solemn prayer, the same as
    anointing the body with holy water.</p>

  <p>The Indians remove the corpse from the house (the reasons being
    explained in another chapter) by making an opening in the wall on the
    left hand side of the door by which they go out, as they never carry
    a corpse through the door. The personal belongings and bedding, also
    the dishes he has used during his illness are taken out through this
    opening upon the removal of the body and everything is burned in a
    large fire made outside of the house.</p>

  <p>With great ceremony and mourning the corpse is carried out of the house
    on the same plank it was laid out on. At the grave they unroll the
    corpse from the blanket, the clothing being cut open down the front,
    the body washed again, this time without the removal of the clothing.
    This final bath is a solution of the Ho-mon-nah roots pounded fine as
    powder and then put into a basket of water. This shrub or plant is
    much different from the wormwood, and it is considered one of their
    best herbs for fumigation and disinfecting purposes. After the bath is
    completed the body is again wrapped in the blanket and laid carefully
    down in the grave. The funeral director, as before, burns a bunch
    of flag grasses over the body, allowing the ashes to fall over the
    remains. Articles they wish to place in the grave with the body are
    put into the grave and the plank that the body was carried out on is
    fitted into the top of the coffin as the top covering. Three or four
    persons take part as pall-bearers in taking the body to the grave. The
    body is laid with the head directly to the west as they say when the
    judgement day comes all the Indians will rise up out of their graves
    facing the rising sun, and those who are worthy will rise in glory to
    the splendors of glory to the Heavenly Father above.</p>

  <p>In this grave things of little value are placed, things usually
    belonging to the deceased. When things of value are placed in the grave
    it is broken up which destroys the value of the article.</p>

  <p>The coffin is covered over with earth, and after this being completed
    they take two stones about eighteen inches long by twelve inches wide,
    one is placed at the head and the other one at the foot of the grave.
    On the top of the stones directly in the middle of the grave they place
    another wide plank about six<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span> feet long and eighteen inches wide.
    Stakes are driven on each side of this plank in the middle and with a
    rope of Indian make they tie the board to the stakes so it can not be
    removed without some difficulty. After this has been completed some dry
    sand is sprinkled around the grave and covering it completely to the
    sides of the wide board, this is done so the Indians can immediately
    detect if any one has molested the grave. The reason why the Indians
    always have their grave-yards near the village or dwelling places is to
    keep the wild animals away from the grave. Sometimes the mourners place
    large baskets on the grave, sometimes two and often many more, there is
    no certain number to use. They are turned upside down, close up to the
    sides of the plank and on the ground around the grave. These baskets
    are made secure by driving a stake through the center of them and into
    the ground. On top of the plank they lay basket plates, also acorn
    baskets. Around the grave a picket fence is made by driving the pickets
    into the ground, a strong hazel withe is tied around them about twelve
    inches below the tops. At the middle of the head and the foot of the
    grave a strong post is driven into the ground that stands much higher
    than the tops of the pickets. To these posts a cross-beam is fastened
    or tied and on this a number of deer skins are hung. These skins are
    dressed whole with the hair left on and the body and head are stuffed
    with weeds. The head is elevated almost perpendicular with the body and
    the legs are left hanging straight down. Some of the clothes that have
    been worn by the deceased are also hung on this cross-beam which makes
    quite a display and would lead one to believe very strongly that many
    valuables were also placed in the grave.</p>

  <p>During and after the burial is completed all the close relatives of the
    deceased weep and wail mournful songs, saying good-bye child, or calling
    out whatever relationship they were to the deceased. The mournful wail
    of an Indian mourner is so intensely sad that the surrounding sky and
    earth seem weeping with the sorrowful ones.</p>

  <p>After the burial rites have been completed those who had taken part in
    the burial go into the family sweat-house where they wash their entire
    bodies from the basket of water containing the ho-mon-nah solution and
    sweat themselves in the sweat-house. After this they all go to the
    river taking the basket of solution<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span> with them and bathe with it in
    the river. Upon returning to the house they all change their clothes
    except the one who dug the grave and he puts on the same clothing
    and wears it for five days longer before he is free from the burial
    rites. His duty now is to kindle a fire which he keeps burning about
    a couple of hours each evening close by the foot of the grave. This
    fire is made between the hours when the first long shadows are cast
    and the twilight gathers into the darkness of the night. They say the
    flickering of the fire-light keeps them from seeing the O’quirlth, the
    spirit of the departed one, which is said to hover over the grave and
    around the home for five days after death. After five days have elapsed
    the spirit departs either to Heaven or to the wilderness, according to
    what kind of life the deceased has lived. The friends and relatives
    of the deceased will weep, wail and pray that his spirit will go the
    narrow road, to the old land, Cheek-cheek-alth, where it will find the
    ladder and climb to Werse-on-now (Heaven). Sometimes a bitter enemy of
    the deceased will pray and hope the departed spirit will go the road to
    Sye-elth where she hands him over to the man in the dead boat where he
    takes the spirit across the river and banishes it into the wilderness.</p>

  <p>The light of the fire keeps the Indians from seeing the spirit when it
    leaves the grave as they never wish to behold spirits. However, they
    claim, in spite of their caution, the spirit is sometimes seen by the
    Indians. They say when it leaves the body it looks like a shadow image
    of the person passing off. They claim a photograph resembles the spirit
    of the dead and the old Indians never want to look at it as they never
    wish to be reminded of the spirit.</p>

  <p>The walls and the floor of the room which the person used is scrubbed
    every day with the ho-mon-nah solution, also whatever furniture there
    is in the room is gone over very carefully with the disinfecting
    process and is kept up for five days until the spirit departs. The
    family lives in the same room as usual, but Cah-ma-tow, the grave
    digger has his own separate bed in the room. He fixes a small board
    for himself on which his meals are served separate from the family
    and dines by himself. The morning of the fifth day he arises earlier
    than usual, making a broom of the boughs of the Douglas spruce and
    sweeps the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span> floor of the house nice and clean. He burns the roots of
    the ho-mon-nah which fumigates the house and with solution made of the
    same plant he scrubs the floor and goes over all the wood-work in the
    house for the last time. After this is finished he gathers up all the
    things he has used during the five days, the baskets of solution, his
    small board table, etc., and takes them all to the sweat-house. Here
    he takes the solution and washes his hands and entire body and after
    he has finished bathing he takes the baskets and clothes he has worn
    up the hill away from the river to a thicket and hangs them all up in
    a small tree, where he leaves them to the elements to decay. He then
    comes back and sweats himself thoroughly, afterwards plunging into the
    river and comes out cleansed of any foul disease he may have contracted
    in handling the dead body.</p>

  <p>The Indians get or hire any one who is willing to do the burial as it
    is not necessary to be a relative or even a well known friend of the
    family.</p>

  <p>During the five days the opening in the house where the dead body was
    taken out is left open as the family and friends never use or go near
    the regular door of the house during this period. After five days have
    elapsed the opening in the wall is sealed up tightly leaving no trace
    that an opening was ever made in the wall. They never leave the gap
    for another case as the Indian never wants to be reminded that another
    death may occur in his household.</p>

  <p>It has often been expressed by the white man that when a funeral is
    held every man, woman and child in the village attends the funeral,
    this is far from being true, not any more than the funeral of a white
    man. Near friends and relatives of the deceased may attend while a
    great many others in the village will go about as usual, not even
    pretending to know that a funeral is being held. Of recent years the
    white man is allowed to help with the burial if he chooses. Valuable
    articles of the dead are not buried with them as is generally believed
    by the white theologist, instead only mere trifles of either little or
    no value placed in and upon the grave.</p>

  <p>When an Indian is very wealthy or rich, and has a family of several
    children he sometimes divides his fortune equally among them, of course
    always making provision for his wife as long she lives and remains
    single. Sometimes he has a favorite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span> son or daughter to whom he leaves
    his entire fortune, disinheriting his other children. The Indian legacy
    is bequeathed to whom he chooses and his will cannot be broken. In
    some cases the wife’s wealth is just as great or even greater than her
    husband’s. She divides her wealth among her children as she chooses,
    the same as her husband.</p>

  <p>When husband and wife have been wedded a number of years and have
    reared a large family, upon the death of the husband the wife cuts her
    hair close to her head and burns it. She keeps her hair cut close to
    her head and is called Ca-win until some one proposes marriage to her
    when she lets it grow out to its natural length again. If she refuses
    the offer of marriage, after her hair has grown over two inches in
    length, she is addressed as Care-rep. This name explains itself, that
    she is a widow and has had an offer of marriage but has refused it. The
    sisters and daughters of a deceased man sometimes cut off a part of
    their hair during their period of mourning for him.</p>

  <div class="subhead">THROUGH THE PEARLY GATES OF HEAVEN.</div>

  <p class="drop-cap">LONG time ago a mother and father resided in Cor-tep village, in the
    house of Metch-cher-rau, located about a half-mile up the river from
    the old Klamath Bluffs store. They had two good children, a boy and
    girl, the girl being the eldest. Brother and sister loved each other
    divinely; their devotion was more divine than human hearts had ever
    known. Their parents were very wealthy, and were married of a good
    marriage ceremony of the wealthy class. Metch-cher-us-ah-may, the
    sister, was the most lovely of all the girls of the tribe; besides
    her rare beauty she possessed a kind and loving disposition beyond
    comparison. When she had grown to womanhood, she went to the Talth, or
    High Priests, and asked them if she might join the sacred lodge. But
    the High Priests sadly shook their heads, and said they could never
    admit her to the sacred lodge, as her parents were not of high birth,
    and that she was not of the Talth marriage. Her pleadings were in vain,
    and she turned away from the lodge deeply grieved, realizing that she
    had been barred forever from the sacred altar of the High Priests,
    and that she could never become a Talth, or mix with the Priests. It
    would be useless to plead again; she was denied their solitary ways of
    worship and she could never sit in their lodge and kindle their sacred
    fires. Her proud spirit was grieved and wounded almost beyond human
    endurance; a great battle now waged within her heart, that God Himself
    might take her above her humble birth and station in life, that she
    might rise in greatness beyond the glories of the High Priests, as she
    would walk in Heaven, and they on earth until death claimed its own.</p>

  <p>She would rise from her bed about four o’clock every morning while the
    villages were yet dark and sleeping and go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span> to gather wood, praying as
    she gathered the branches in her basket, and when it was filled she
    would return to her house, praying all the while, and leave the wood
    there long before any one was astir to see her at work. After this task
    was done she would go to a high rock on the hill-side in a small creek,
    a short distance from the Cor-tep village, where she would spend the
    entire day on top of this rock, praying to God and weaving baskets.
    There was a small basin of water in this solid rock close by where she
    sat, which she used to keep her basket materials wet as she worked
    them. The rock was very high when she sat upon it long ages ago, but it
    is nearly covered with earth at this present writing. At evening-tide
    she would return to her home. So earnest were her prayers, so patient
    was her humble soul in waiting that she prayed a number of years on top
    of this rock, ere her prayers were answered in Heaven. Praying in the
    great solitudes of a vast creation she never faltered, but prayed on
    to the Heavenly Father that he might give her strength and courage to
    become far more pure than any that had ever lived on earth before her,
    that she might rise as a virgin of purity above her people, leaving in
    her footsteps the holy halo when she had passed from the earth away to
    the realms of Heaven above.</p>

  <p>This beautiful woman, made far more beautiful in her purity, the
    sublime whiteness of her soul shining forth, transfigured beyond the
    glories of womanhood. After these years of faithful prayer, dark
    suspicions and intrigues rose from the people of the villages, as
    her actions seemed so strange and why one so beautiful should always
    be solitary. No doubt some youth was yearning for the beauty of her
    arms to encircle him, the sweetness of her smile had fascinated all,
    as her sweetness was so perfect. She was always alone, and there did
    not seem to be anything to prevent it. Day by day the village folks
    grew more restless in their surmises of their doubts and fears for her
    safety, and they brought the tale to her parents who accused her of
    clandestine meetings with some unscrupulous man who no doubt had ruined
    her virtuous womanhood, and that they would soon cast her from the
    village in disgrace if she persisted in her lone walks to the woods in
    the early morning and kept solitary place on the rock during the day.</p>

  <p>How unjust we sometimes accuse the innocent; how deep the wounds we
    thrust that we mourn in after years in sad regret<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span> of our cruel words
    spoken when God has taken them away and they no longer soothe our dark
    afflictions. Rising in wounded pride once more she proclaimed her
    innocence, that her soul was free from this preposterous accusation. So
    long she had been patient and true, so long she had denied herself the
    pleasures and passions of earth, directing her thoughts to lofty ideals
    she could proudly verify when the time came for her to go to the Throne
    on High, when the Heavenly Father would call her to the Eternal Home.
    She said she could not tell her parents and the people her reasons and
    account for her actions now; why she would always get up so early in
    the morning to get her wood, and why she spent the entire days upon the
    rock. But she assured them that they would all know at a future time
    why she spent so many hours of solitude, this time would be when God
    called her Home, and they would repent for their cruel accusations.</p>

  <p>During these years of patient prayer, brother and sister met in loving
    companionship of sympathy and exchanging the prayer of their ambitions.
    Metch-cher-us-ah-chene, the brother, knew the secret prayers of his
    devout sister, and by them his thoughts were directed to higher ideals.
    Pledged by solemn vows, he would never make known her secret prayers,
    until she herself was ready for him to do so. They prayed together, he
    alone at his fishing, she alone on the high rock at her basket weaving,
    their prayers united. However, his faith in God was not so strong, and
    his prayers were not so earnest as his sister’s, that the future years
    left him alone on earth to mourn her loss.</p>

  <p>Metch-cher-us-ah-may heeded not the warnings of her people as she
    continued to rise in the early morning hours to gather her wood before
    the light of day, so that no one would feast their unscrupulous eyes
    upon her while she was at work. After this task was done she would go
    as usual to the high rock and weave baskets the whole day through until
    evening, saying her prayers all the while.</p>

  <p>Spring time had come when all the leaves of the trees and shrubbery had
    grown up, and the sap of the maple tree was full. Metch-cher-us-ah-may
    peeled the maple tree of its bark and took the inner layers that grow
    upon the surface of the hard wood of the tree and out of this bark
    she made a dress of beautiful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span> fringes, softer than silk itself, as
    it hung in ripples about her body. From the yellow-hammer she plucked
    its beautiful golden feathers and made a cape in which she wrapped her
    shoulders and arms. Spring-time waned and mid-summer came; it was the
    last summer that she would spend on earth, as her faithful prayers
    had been answered and she was now ready to be taken to Werse-on-now
    (Heaven). Ah, she could now mount to the glories of Heaven without
    passing through that dark and shadowy vale of death. The High Priests,
    who had turned her away from the scared lodge, together with the other
    people, would all have to die and the earth would give them a grave.
    Their hands would never touch her body, the earth would give her no
    grave, but instead, her body would be carried through the winds and
    storms until she reached that Infinite Shore where she would dwell in
    the flowery meadows of Heaven.</p>

  <p>The evening before the day of her departure she brought all of her
    baskets she had made to her home and gave all of her wealth to her
    brother, telling him to watch for her in the early morning, as she was
    departing for a far better throne than she had ever known upon earth.
    In the early morning hours, ere the sun was shining over the mountains
    of the Klamath, she bathed her body with sweet scented herbs, put on
    her new maple dress and draped her shoulders with the gorgeous dyes of
    the yellow-hammer feathers, her long raven locks were combed and left
    flowing about her shoulders. Bidding her brother good-bye, he beheld
    her mount the rock where she had sat so many years in devout prayer;
    he alone saw her rise from the earth to go to the realms above. Swift
    as the lightning from Heaven she mounted the rock, bowing to the great
    creation of the world with her arms outstretched and her beautiful hair
    flowing, she stood erect with her face to Heaven in the north with her
    eyes closed. Out of the north, on his mighty wings, rose the red eagle
    and came to her feet on the rock. Dipping her hand to the west, to the
    land of the setting sun, she bade the world farewell and mounted the
    eagle’s back. With outstretched wings, gorgeously tipped in crimson,
    he rose from the rock with his fair princess mounted securely upon his
    back, and flew with her to the far north from whence he came. In the
    early dawn of the rising sun, in all the glories of Indian summer, her
    brother saw her mount the eagle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span> and fly away to the Kingdom of Heaven,
    passing not through the gates of death.</p>

  <p>She sat on the eagle’s back through the long journey, with her eyes
    always closed, her arms raised above her shoulders and her hands
    folded at the back of her head and neck. The eagle on his long journey
    north to the land of Cheek-cheek-alth, commanded her not to open her
    eyes, though the storms from Heaven may feel severe against her face
    and body. Rising from the earth she felt the heat of the still Indian
    summer beat like fire upon her. Far away they soared and the eagle
    said, “You will now feel the mighty winds of Heaven sweep around you
    in piercing gales, but do not open your eyes.” Far up through the
    winds they soared and she opened her eyes not. Far on they flew and
    he said again, “You will feel the rain pouring in torrents upon you,
    but you must never open your eyes.” Through the rain they went until
    he again said, “You will now feel the cold fall like piercing blades
    of ice but you must never open your eyes.” Through the piercing cold
    they flew, her eyes always shut, until he said again, “You will now
    feel the snow fall thick and fast upon you, but you must not open your
    eyes.” Through the mighty winds and the cold, fierce storms of Heaven
    they had flown, until the eagle at last exclaimed, “You will feel the
    warmth of pleasant summer again, open your eyes and I will leave you
    in that sublime land of Cheek-cheek-alth.” She opened her eyes for the
    first time during her long flight through the airy regions and beheld
    the beauteous land of Cheek-cheek-alth, the old land that gave birth
    to our people long ages ago. She now stood upon the banks of the most
    sublime river the world has ever known, with its hallowed charms and
    brilliant gems of fortune, its mystic waters of transparent brilliancy
    flowing sweet and peaceful through the valley of Cheek-cheek-alth. On
    the shores of this wonderful river she beheld millions of the dead
    turk-tum (short shells of the Indian money) shining from the sands of
    the water. From this river long centuries ago, when the Indians first
    left their native land in search of the new world they brought with
    them the cheek, or Indian money. They say this money is found in no
    other clime except in the old land of Cheek-cheek-alth, the land of
    their birth. They do not use the dead turk-tum washed upon the banks
    of the river for money, but fish for the live cheek in the river which
    they catch the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span> same as fish, and out of these live shells make their
    cheek or money. This money through the long evolution of centuries has
    been handed down from one generation to another.</p>

  <p>In the land of Cheek-cheek-alth, this divine princess found the ladder
    that goes to Heaven and climbed it, round by round, until she reached
    Heaven. All of her tribulations of earth, were finished, the false
    accusations of cruel friends could no longer thrust their wounds into
    her blameless soul as she now sat glorified on a Throne of Eternal
    Splendors, truly a Saint in Heaven.</p>

  <p>Several days had elapsed since the departure of Metch-cher-us-ah-may
    and the people began to inquire why she returned no more to the house
    at night-fall. They went in search of her and found the wood baskets
    she had used here on earth, left on top of the high rock where she had
    taken her flight. Her brother then informed them that his sister had
    gone to Werse-on-now as he had beheld the vision himself. The parents
    recalling to mind the harsh words spoken of their dark suspicions
    concerning their saint-like daughter, wept and wailed most bitterly,
    and were bowed down with heavy hearts and sad regrets, that one so true
    could no longer stay on earth; that God should so early call the divine
    and true to His Eternal Home.</p>

  <p>The brother who had loved his sister so devotedly, recalled to memory
    the tender devotion of her trying years of patience. Heart wrung with
    the strange pathetic life of his sister and the charm of its beautiful
    ending, he wept until his proud heart seemed broken asunder. Weeping
    tears of blood it seemed, from the heart that loved so much, for the
    gentle hand that touched his brow, the hallowed form, the low voice and
    cheering smile was gone forever.</p>

  <p>After a few days, the bitter wailing of her parents and the intense
    grief of her brother was answered by the gentle Saint herself. Her
    spirit came earthward in a shadowy image, or o’quirlth, and appeared
    before her loved ones, soothing them with gentle words of compassion
    in their dark hours of grief and sad regrets, assuring them that she
    dwelt safely beyond the Pearly Gates of Heaven, in the infinite
    meadows of beauty and light. Their misgivings no longer wounded,
    for her spirit survived in peace and happiness and for them to weep
    bitterly no more.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span> Her spirit faded from the earth, leaving her parents
    assured of the eternal years of her greatness, a Saint in Heaven.</p>

  <p>Her brother, Metch-cher-us-ah-chene, could not be comforted long, as
    he had only known a sister’s love and tender devotion. Day by day he
    grieved more and more in his loneliness, a sorrow that knows no comfort
    when the loved one has gone to realms beyond. His grief became so great
    that he could not long endure it, when her spirit answered him in his
    loneliness once more. This time she appeared before him in her living
    form as she had lived on earth, and brother and sister met in sweet
    earthly communion for the last time as she would return to comfort them
    no more. She lifted that heavy veil of sorrow from his heart and gave
    him courage in earthly things again. She instructed him to go to a
    riffle on the Klamath river, opposite the old Klamath Bluffs store and
    fish there for twelve days, at the end of which he would catch a small
    fish about the size of one’s little finger, and that this fish would
    have many white rings encircling its body. This fish as soon as it was
    caught was to be put in an elk-horn Indian purse, which is beautifully
    carved out of the elk’s horn and polished smooth on the internal and
    external surfaces. They sometimes carve and color very artistic designs
    upon them, cutting out a small oblong lid in the middle of the purse
    which they fit on it after putting the money in and wrap the lid on
    securely with a strip of buck-skin.</p>

  <p>Metch-cher-us-ah-chene fished on the riffle for twelve days as directed
    by his sister and at the closing of the twelfth day he caught the
    small fish, which he put in the elk-horn purse, and then the raven,
    or qua-gawk, came to him and said for him to mount his back, which he
    did and then the raven commanded him to close his eyes and keep them
    tightly closed until he was told to open them. The raven flew with him
    through sunny regions, rain, cold, sleet, snow and over icy fields,
    taking the same route that the red eagle had flown with his sister.
    Over the icy fields he could feel the ice with his hands, then after
    this the raven sat him down, in a warm place and commanded him to
    keep his eyes closed, and the raven flew on and left him alone for a
    short time. While alone he began to feel around as he could not open
    his eyes, he felt in the sandy soil around him and felt that it was
    covered with cheek, (the shell of the Indian money) and he began to
    rake it up in heaps around him. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span> the raven returned he said that
    he must leave the cheek where it was found, as it was too heavy to
    carry so far. Metch-cher-us-ah-chene mounted the raven’s back again
    and away they flew to the land of Cheek-cheek-alth, which was only a
    short distance from where raven had first left him. Upon arriving in
    this land, the raven set him down on the banks of the wonderful river,
    Wer-roy, where the climate is always warm and pleasant, the valley
    forever green and the fruits and flowers forever bloomed through one
    long perpetual summer day. On the banks of this glorious river the
    raven said for him to open his eyes and fish in its brilliant waters
    for one of the living cheek, or little shell fish. Fishing in this
    river of sublime beauty he caught this rare and precious shell fish
    which the raven said he must put in the elk-horn purse with the other
    fish his sister had told him to catch in the Klamath river. He put the
    two fishes together as he had been instructed, and lo, vast riches soon
    followed. The fish he had caught in the Klamath was the female fish,
    while the one he had caught in the river of Cheek-cheek-alth was the
    male fish.</p>

  <p>Metch-cher-us-ah-chene mounted the raven’s back again, the raven
    instructing him to keep his eyes closed as before, and they flew back
    to the Klamath river, back to the Cor-tep village. When they reached
    the Klamath river the raven instructed him to make twelve of these
    elk horn purses as large as the horns would permit and he made twelve
    of the largest kind that he could, and as the male and female cheek
    would breed little cheek in the small purse he would take the young
    cheek just as soon as they were large enough and place them in one
    of the larger purses. He kept on breeding cheek in this way until he
    had all of his large purses filled with money, or cheek, and he now
    began putting the cheek in a large basket. His riches were growing so
    large that he did not know what he was going to do with so much money.
    Finding himself so lonely in the midst of his vast riches he wooed a
    wife from the Pec-toolth village where the Trinity river flows into
    the Klamath. Following the custom of marriage his name was changed
    to Pec-tow, adopting his wife’s name, and she taking his name. After
    they had been married but a short time his ambitions died within him
    and he lost interest in his work and neglected the teachings of his
    sister. Now the two fishes made their escape from the breeding purse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
    and turned into a worm or bug, about an inch long, with white and black
    stripes on their bodies and two long horns on their heads. These worms
    can be found along the river banks around the large rocks, and the
    Indians always consider it good luck to find one of them, as they catch
    and put them away in a purse to keep them for good luck. After the
    escape of these fishes he no longer had the power to accumulate vast
    riches and ill luck followed.</p>

  <p>His wife gave birth to a handsome boy, but it was said that God was
    displeased and caused the child to die. A second child was born to
    them, this time a beautiful baby girl, but it died also. A third child
    was born, another beautiful baby girl, but God too took it away as he
    had taken the others. A fourth child to this unhappy couple was born, a
    boy, it was still said that God was displeased with his marriage, and
    the handsome babe followed its brother and sisters in Heaven. At the
    death of the fourth child, Metch-cher-us-ah-chene became very sad and
    thoughtful. So sad and heavy was his heart that earth seemed to him but
    dreary waste without the noise and prattle of his beautiful babies. He
    thought long and could not understand why God took the innocent and
    pure away to His Heavenly Home so soon.</p>

  <p>Rising in the early morning he would weep as he went up the mountain
    side to gather a load of sweat-house wood, and with this on his
    shoulders he started to the sweat-house in the village, singing and
    weeping as he went, “I-a-quay, tus,” saying he was very sorry for his
    children. The mourner sat down to rest, putting the load of wood on the
    ground and resting his back and shoulders against the load. When he
    had rested sufficiently, he tried to rise with his load in the usual
    manner but there was a heavy weight on his load and he could not rise;
    as if some one was holding him down. He looked around but saw no one,
    so he tried again and was able to rise with the wood. He sat down a
    second time and rested with his wood and as before when he began to
    rise up he could not, but after looking around and seeing no one, he
    was able to get up all right. He sat down and rested a third time when
    the same thing happened and upon reaching home he made a fire in the
    sweat-house and sweated himself in the usual manner, after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span> which he
    went to the river and took a cold plunge in the water. Coming out of
    the plunge he went back to the sweat-house and seated himself in front
    of the door, and gazed far off in the distance, imagining that he could
    see the spirit, O’quirlth, and at the same time his wife was calling
    him to dinner. He continued to sit there gazing far beyond the earth.
    He did not answer her calls, his spirit had gone to join his sister in
    Werse-on-now, where she resided in Heaven with God. There you may see
    brother and sister straying together in the infinite meadows of Heaven
    and about them his beautiful babes, the pure buds of the blooming
    meadows.</p>

  <p>After the death of Metch-cher-us-ah-chene his wife returned to her
    native village at Peck-toolth where the Trinity and the Klamath rivers
    come together. She took with her the large basket with cheek, (money)
    and after a time married a man of the Weitchpec village which is
    located on the north side of the Klamath river opposite the mouth of
    the Trinity river. From her second marriage she had one son, and all
    the cheek she had brought with her made these two villages very rich
    from this time on.</p>

    <h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="subhead">BURIAL CUSTOMS:<br /><br />
    WHY THE DEAD ARE NEVER TAKEN<br />THROUGH THE DOOR.</div>

  <p class="drop-cap">MANY generations ago, there was a woman born and reared at a village
    called Os-sa-gon and which is located some six or seven miles south of
    the mouth of the Klamath river, on the ocean shore. Some years ago this
    place was a very large village of the Klamath Indians.</p>

  <p>When this woman had grown into beautiful womanhood she was wooed and
    won by a young man of the Wah-teck village, which is located near the
    old Klamath Bluffs store and near the White Deer-skin dancing grounds.
    They were both of wealthy families, and celebrated their nuptials of
    good ceremony of the middle class. During their wedded life they were
    very happy together, three little ones came to bless this happy union,
    one boy and two girls. After the third child was born the husband
    became very ill and entered into the shadowy valley of death, leaving
    his young widow and children to mourn his untimely departure.</p>

  <p>Up until his death, it had always been the custom of the Indians to
    take the dead body out of the house through the door, and as they
    carried it through they would take the ashes from the fire-place in the
    house and throw them through the door as the body was carried out. The
    ash dust was allowed to remain until the wind had swept it away. This
    had been their custom from generation to generation. They had performed
    the same rite with him but in this a strange coincidence happened which
    changed their custom in removing the dead from the house.</p>

  <p>After his burial was over and his wife had once more become reconciled
    to her daily routine of work, she would sit and weave baskets with her
    face toward the door, which was contrary to the Indian teachings, as
    one should never sit facing the door<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span> but must always sit with their
    backs turned upon it. She did not think this teaching of any importance
    and always sat with her face toward the door while at work on her
    baskets, and at short intervals she would look up from her basket and
    glance at the door.</p>

  <p>Nearly a year had elapsed, when one day while she was sitting weaving
    her basket, thinking intently of her husband, how happy their wedded
    life had been, how devotedly she had loved him in life and how deeply
    she mourned his loss, seemingly his departed spirit answered her from
    the unknown world. Glancing up at the door she beheld his spirit, and
    dropped her basket with a sudden cry of joy and sprang to the door that
    she might take him in her arms, that he might never more leave her in
    her loneliness. Instead of her husband, the loved one, she caught in
    her arms the post which stands as a supporting column on the outside
    of the inner door, or between the inner and outer door of the Indian
    house. Her conscious self left her as she thought he was trying to get
    away from her, and, thinking that she had fastened her hold upon his
    leg, instead she was clinging to the post. Her once supple body and
    limbs became as rigid as iron when her children and folks gathered
    around her and tried to make her let go of the post, but their efforts
    were of no avail for she only clung the tighter. At last they were
    compelled to cut away the post before they were able to move her to a
    bed, where they did everything possible to restore her. She remained
    in this state of unconsciousness for several days, when they decided
    to take her down to the river and put her into a canoe. They took her
    down as far as Blue Creek (Ur-ner), some eight miles, and then turning
    back and coming up the river to Notch-co, some eight miles above the
    Wah-teck village, making sixteen miles in all. In these sixteen miles
    the river changes its course from due north swinging around in the
    different bends, west to nearly south. They kept taking the woman up
    and down the river the whole summer, until late in the Autumn, and
    kept her alive during this period by nourishing her with the marrow
    fat from the leg bones of the deer, of which they applied to her lips
    and breasts by rubbing. When she had fully regained her consciousness
    she would, during all her spare time, weave baskets. The main frame or
    rib work of the basket are hazel switches which is called ho-lealth.
    In drawing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span> or weaving the work in and out over the switches they
    turn to the left hand side and the basket-maker always keeps a basket
    of water within her reach, and at short intervals dips her hand into
    the water, moistens the switches and straightens them back into their
    proper places, thus building the basket up straight. This woman never
    straightened back the switches of her basket, therefore, they were made
    into a round twist. The children would say to their mother, (Calk) “Why
    don’t you straighten the switches on your basket?” She would always
    reply, “Never mind, that is alright”, and tell them to stop talking
    so much about her basket weaving. She kept on weaving baskets in this
    manner until all of her children had grown up into man and womanhood.</p>

  <p>One evening as the twilight was fast gathering into darkness, she was
    sitting working on her baskets as usual, with her basket material
    around her, she simply said, “My time has come, my husband is waiting
    for me.” She picked up her basket she was weaving and placed it on the
    fire, saying her spirit, O’quirlth, would have it to use while she was
    leaving for the world beyond the grave, and died. Her children and her
    husband’s folks had gathered around in her last dying moments.</p>

  <p>The Indians now keep the dead body for one whole day, (twenty-four
    hours) to satisfy themselves that life has actually departed. They bury
    the body and after it is laid in the grave, they say that the spirit,
    O’quirlth, remains hovering around the living and near the newly made
    grave for five days. When five days have elapsed the spirit departs,
    and if the individual has lived a good moral life, his spirit goes
    to Cheek-cheek-alth, there finds the ladder and climbs to God, where
    he dwells forever in eternal happiness. If he is a mean and degraded
    wretch his spirit goes the broad road to the old woman and the dog,
    where she hands him over to the man in the dead boat and he takes the
    wicked spirit across the river and leaves him to wail in the wilderness
    of anguish until the judgement day.</p>

  <p>When that woman died they did not take her through the door, but made
    an opening in the wall on the left hand side of the door as one stands
    on the inside of the house facing the door. From this time on they have
    never taken a dead body through the door, but always make an opening
    in the side of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span> house on the left hand side, through which they
    take the body. The Indians teach their children never to stop or stand
    in the door-way, in going or coming in. One will never see any one,
    old or young, stop, stand or sit in the door of an Indian house. Since
    the death of this woman they always burn the basket material of the
    deceased, or any unfinished work that belongs to the one that has just
    died.</p>

  <p>There is a coarse grass, a sort of saw grass, that grows on the ridges
    and under the tan-oaks and fir timber which they use in nearly all
    their baskets, and this grass we call ham-mo. When one dies and the
    body is taken out of the house, they place some of this woven grass
    over the door on the inside, in a manner that one would not notice
    it, unless it was shown to them. The family will wear strands around
    their necks, and this is done to prevent them from seeing or meeting
    the spirit which hovers around and near the body for five days before
    departing for the unknown realms beyond.</p>

  <p>The custom of cutting the hair on the death of a near kindred extends
    back to the time when they were in the old land, Cheek-cheek-alth.</p>

  <div class="subhead">THE INDIAN DEVIL.</div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE Klamath Indians in bringing down their legends from the creation
    of man until the present day, say that some were made to be good
    and honorable, some bad and some were real bad and mean, which they
    termed devils, or Oh-mah-ha. We have the conception of the invisible
    Satan, (Sey-elth, or wicked old woman) and a real living devil such
    as walks the earth, and we fear them as they will harm us if they
    get the opportunity. We have had these living Indian devils (living
    human beings) all through the long and weary centuries, ever since the
    creation of man-kind, such devils as we find in every race and nation
    of the earth. Our Indian devils are Indians who for some reason or
    cause leave the tribe and go far away into the lonely mountains, and
    into the depths of the forests, where they live near the streams and
    places almost inaccessible. In their loneliness they roam through the
    forests and over the mountains like some wild animals of prey. They
    forget the language of their mothers and become something like wild
    beasts, fleeing from the sight of human beings.</p>

  <p>In olden times, the women, especially were always careful to keep
    together on their camping trips when they were gathering the acorn
    crop, grass seeds, pine nuts, etc., for fear of these Indian devils.
    These Indian devils would sometimes watch the camps of the Indians
    very closely and follow them about as they moved from place to place,
    watching for an opportunity to seize one of the young women and carry
    her off to make her his wife. If a young woman strayed away too far
    by herself, she was often made a captive by one of these devils. The
    women<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span> of the tribe had great fear of them as they had great horrors of
    becoming the wife of a wild man.</p>

  <p>Sometimes the women would be captivated by the Indian devils and would
    be gone away from their tribe for years, when they would return and
    tell of their wild life and experiences. They would become the mother
    of children and the children would inherit the wild habits of their
    father, as they would always be whistling, making strange noises,
    romping wildly about and always on the go, roaming everywhere in the
    wilds. These women were never happy when they came back to their
    people, as after a time they would long to go back to their devil
    husbands and children. They always managed to get away and return to
    the old wild life, as it held such a fascination for them, when they
    once experienced the wilds that they could not resist the calling of
    such a life.</p>

  <p>When the Indians would go on their hunting and camping trips into the
    mountains, as soon as they heard an owl screech or hoot, they would
    stop and listen, and try to distinguish if it was an Indian devil
    imitating the owl or the cry of a wild animal. The Indians would stop
    at once, kindle a fire and hallo; this was given as a warning to the
    devils that they were awake and ready to fight them if necessary.</p>

  <p>When the Indians go camping far back into the mountains, and even if
    a white man accompanies them, they always insist on making the first
    camp fire, when a camping place is selected. In building the fire the
    first stick of wood they lay down points directly north and south,
    on the north end of this stick of wood they place another stick some
    eight or twelve inches back from the north end, placing this branch
    east and west, thus making a cross. When the cross is made they proceed
    to kindle the fire, and during the whole time they are offering up a
    prayer to God in a low tone of voice. This prayer is earnestly offered
    up to the Almighty asking Him to protect them from the Indian devils
    and wild animals, while they are in the wilds and to keep them from
    accidents. After the first worship has been offered up any one can
    build the camp fire as long as they camp in the same place, and the
    Indians do not repeat this form of worship until they move away to a
    different camping place. The Indian places his soul in the care of God,
    and worships at his shrine under the open Heavens and boundless skies,
    and not at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span> religion and traditions of another race that has a
    tradition from the beginning of the creation of a living man, and down
    through the long centuries of thousands of years. If this is true, let
    me quote from the so called civilized races, for instance, Rome had its
    Caesar, oft writ in history, “Great and brave,” but all the world knows
    that he lived the heartless conqueror, crushing out the lives of men,
    his hands were dipped in human blood and he died the tyrant’s death.
    All the world knows that France had its monarch, his name is writ on
    Fame’s record as the mighty conqueror of Europe. The winding rivers of
    Europe were once red with the blood it shed, there were gory battle
    fields left in his wake, to say nothing of broken hearted mothers and
    children who went weeping under cheerless skies without a home to
    shelter them. For example, our own United States, in 1861–65, cities
    went down in ruins, homes were destroyed, human blood flowed like wine,
    thousands sleep in unknown graves, they died martyrs for a great cause,
    and the Redman was just as much of a martyr for his cause as they.</p>

  <p>Truly our tribes were not blood-thirsty, for the love of blood or the
    lust of glory, but instead were compelled to yield to a superior race,
    and our noblest men sleep in narrow graves with the best, the proudest
    of the race, dead around them. Exterminated rather than educated until
    the noblest of our race are gone, and out of the miserable remnant
    comes a feeble cry today, that for nearly four centuries the redman
    has merely existed without a country. Love for the child-race of a
    bygone age, tears for the infant race, in all its infancy a type of
    primitive manhood, reserved and poised, courageous, enduring, master
    of self and above all self controlled, a proud vanishing figure in a
    nation of unrest. Love for the adult race saddened with regrets hanging
    heavy and the stain of blood on their hands from the infant tears for
    the superior race, for who can tell what this child-race might have
    been when they were full grown and educated. Tears and love, love
    and tears, sweetly mingled when infant and adult meet in one great
    brotherhood of forgiveness. Always thus, since time began, someone
    must die a martyr for the beginning of every cause, and it has ever
    been thus, since the dawn of history, among all races and nations, the
    heathen, the barbarian and the civilized nations of the world.</p>

  <p>Educated man today through his long evolution of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span> centuries know there
    is only one God, and all are seeking one goal and the soul of man
    cannot be lost just because he worships a little different from his
    fellow man. Every race has its own creed, and one race has no more of
    a right to say another race is lost forever and eternally just because
    they differ in their form of worship, and the rising generation of the
    present century knows better. So at least let the tradition of the
    noble type be just, as he is being fast absorbed into another race
    and even at this day all that remains of him is tradition of his past
    existence, and usually that tradition is of a mongrel type, rather than
    the true.</p>

  <p>We are always afraid of the visible devil, (oh-mah-ha) that is
    the living devil here on this earth, as we are compelled to guard
    continually against these monsters in keeping ourselves from being
    harmed. We are at all times at peace with God, we love Him as the Great
    Ruler and we are always ready to offer a prayer and to worship him.</p>

  <p>When an Indian sits down to smoke, he fills his pipe, lights it and
    takes a deep breath filling his lungs with smoke, and then expels it
    slowly through his nostrils and mouth with a low grunt. Then in a low
    and solemn voice he offers up a prayer to God, asking Him for good
    health, long life and good luck. This good luck is in earning money,
    accumulating vast riches, success in fishing and securing wild game,
    and in fact all the success in the pursuit of an Indian life.</p>

  <p>The devil is termed as key-mol-len, which means a low miserable person
    or animal. And God is in the Heavens an invisible Being to living man,
    he is everywhere and He rules over all.</p>

  <div class="subhead">THE WHITE DEER-SKIN DANCE.</div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE fish dam being completed, all except the ones that are to stay
    there, Lock-nee, Normer, the Wah-clures and the Char-rahs now move
    down the river and go to their different homes to prepare for the White
    Deer-skin Dance. This dance is held about ten miles down the river
    from where the fish dam is put in, and this place they call Wah-tec
    and is a pretty place containing about fifty acres, of a nearly level
    place, being a high bar or flat so that no water ever gets over it, and
    situated on the north side of the river, just down under the village
    on gentle sloping place. There is a large spring of cold water flowing
    from under the upper flat or high bar, while some forty steps below the
    dance ground there is another spring, larger than the other, clear and
    cold, which is used for part of them that camp, all being some three
    hundred yards down the river below the old Klamath Bluff’s or Johnson’s
    store, that was put there in the year 1855 or 1856 by a man named
    Schneider, and owned so long by Bill McGarvey. Before the dance starts
    two that are of high birth, one girl and one man, the man can be young
    or old but they must be of high birth, and sometimes one of them is a
    Talth, goes first and cleans off the ground, (all of which parts I have
    taken) by taking the grass off, then sweep it clean, then three smooth
    stones that are set well down in the ground but extending above the
    ground some eight or ten inches. These stones have been for a long time
    and are for the three in the center of the row of dancers, which are
    fifteen and seventeen in number; the girl makes a small fire and then
    places her incense roots on it to burn so as to please Wah-pec-wah-mow,
    she remains there to keep up the fire while the dance is in progress.
    This man and girl are called May-wa-lep, and eat their regular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span> meals
    each day. When all is in readiness for the dance to start in the
    evening of the first day, the two first villages up the river from the
    dancing place, all dressed in their robes and regalia, go down to the
    river bank and get into a large boat or canoe, one sits in the stern
    to paddle and keep it pointed down the river until they come to where
    they have prepared their camping place for the dance. The first village
    up is called Cor-tep, and the next one above it is Pec-wan, Pec-wan is
    where the big Talth Lodge is situated for the Po-lick-las division,
    and is very wealthy. This village is my birthplace and always comes
    in strong with the finest of regalia and the most beautiful display
    of deer skins. Now each village dances separate and one at a time, as
    the Cor-tep village dancers come up and form themselves into line, the
    three in the center are the leaders and the middle one of the three is
    the one that lowers the pole that has the deer skin on it. He raises
    his right foot and starts to sing, letting his foot down at the same
    time, and the rest all follow. Now there stands at each end of the row
    of dancers those who in their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span> right hand hold a large flint which they
    call Ne-gam, this has a strong buck skin string tied tightly around it
    and then looped around the wrist so as to keep it from slipping off the
    hand, and as the dancing starts they go back and forth in front of the
    row of dancers passing each other at middle of the row of dancers, and
    they have a whistle in progress. After dancing until they are all tired
    out, they stop and the three in the middle of the row sit down on the
    stones while the rest stand, all raising the pole on which the deer
    skins are held, letting the butt end of the pole rest on the ground.
    After the Cor-tep village has danced out they retire to their camp,
    and in from fifteen to thirty minutes the Pec-wan village dancers come
    up and go through the same performance. The regalia and deer skins are
    the common kind, and the count of the days that the dance is to run
    has not yet commenced as these two villages may dance two dances for
    each day, after the first evening, for three or four days before the
    rest of them can get ready to come, there are five of them in all.
    Next above Pec-wan to come is Ser-e-goine then Mo-reck and the next is
    Cap-pell where the fish dam is, when they all get to the dancing place
    they dance ten days and each village dances in its turn. They start the
    first dance about nine o’clock in the morning and it is fully twelve
    o’clock, midday, before the last one has finished. Now bear in mind
    that there are two or three men all the time in the different camps
    asking the men, one and all to come in and dance, it does not matter
    from where they come or to what tribe they belong, they are asked to
    come in and take a part in this great festival, so that the dancers
    are changing all the time, and from one village to the other and which
    ever village they dance in, they are invited to eat at their camp all
    is free and no one is allowed to go hungry, and there would be some
    from far off that could not speak a word of the Klamath tongue only
    by signs with the hands, yet they were carefully looked after, shown
    around, fed and asked to get in and dance, the others carefully guiding
    them through so they would make no mistake and it was considered the
    worst of ill manners to make light of their mistakes anywhere in their
    presence, they were guaranteed protection and courtesy and seen to get
    home without being harmed or molested.</p>

    <div class="caption">BEGINNING OF THE WHITE DEER-SKIN DANCE.</div>
  </div>

  <p>The different dance camps have a number of women,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span> sometimes eight ten
    or twelve and they work like beavers, cooking and preparing the food,
    these women are the sisters, aunts and other relatives. Some of them
    may own one half of all the valuable parts of what they are dancing
    with and all may own some part. As with the Klamath Indians the women
    own by inheritance or accumulation all of their own wealth just the
    same as the men do and a wealthy woman is just as much sought for a
    wife by the Klamath Indians as they are by the whites and just the same
    a wealthy man is sought for by the women as they are by the whites.</p>

  <p>The girl keeps her fire burning while the dance is going on and the man
    assists her at all times. Now the village to which the dance belongs
    starts about dark in the evening and goes through the same performance,
    each giving a dance, keeping it up till about nine o’clock at night,
    when they retire to their different camps where they all take their
    evening meal, after this they all prepare to sleep for the night, and
    the most of them sleep until full daylight in the morning, when they
    rise to go through the same routine. On the last day at this place,
    or the tenth day of the dance, (oh-pure-ah-wah) this being the great
    day, all that are to be there have come, and this day they bring out
    the white deer-skins, the longest of the flints, some of which were
    red while others were streaked with red and white, the white being the
    most valuable, some of them are twenty and twenty-two inches in length
    and from four to five inches wide in the center of the blade and quite
    heavy to handle; at this the Pec-wan village leads all others in white
    deer-skins, they having five that are white and many that are light or
    nearly white, all being dressed softly and nicely with the whole skin,
    nose, ears and the hair left on, even the hoofs are white and the nose
    and ears are decorated with the red feathers of the woodcock or Indian
    hen taken from the scalp of the bird and put on stripes of buck-skin
    with small pieces of the abalone shell hanging down in front of the
    nose of the deer some four inches long. Ser-e-goine comes next with the
    longest flints, the most valuable belonging to a family of sisters,
    and the other villages that make up the five come in, in rotation
    as to riches in valuable articles for the dance, now the upper river
    or Pech-ic-las comes in to the different dances with their valuables
    as to the line of relationship or old time friendship, and the women
    put in their wealth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span> and take their places and help to cook and wait
    on all just the same as the Po-lick-las, yet they speak a different
    language but are so closely mixed in marriage and so many of them
    speak both tongues and the whole meaning of the big dance being just
    the same to both that there is no mistake between them in any part of
    the management of the dance. The men all wear a buck-skin blanket made
    of two and three deer skins, dressed with the hair on and made very
    soft, these are sewed together with the sinews of the deer, used for
    thread, with a bone needle and to the lower part of the blanket they
    sew the tails of the civet or ring tail cat. This blanket is fixed so
    as to be tied around the waist and hangs down below the knees with
    the cat tails dangling at the bottom, if clear dry weather they wear
    these blankets with the hair side next to their skin, which leaves
    them looking very white, but if it turns damp or commences to rain the
    blankets are turned with the hair side out so as not to get the flesh
    side wet and soiled. All of the dancers have great rolls of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span> shell
    beads, called Turk-tum, strung around the neck, hanging down over the
    breast and reaching to the waist. These shells are the same species of
    shells as the cheek, only they are shorter and do not have the value
    by from fifty to one hundred times as much, and all have head dresses
    but no feathers only the one bald eagle or other eagle feather that is
    stuck in the back of the hair and stands up perpendicular. The four men
    that stand at the end of the row of dancers and which carry the large
    flints and whistles in their mouths have for a head-dress a close woven
    cloth which we make ourselves from the small tread fibers of the flag,
    these are twisted into strands and woven into a thick, heavy cloth,
    these are some eight inches wide by three feet in length, or more,
    and are ornamented with the tusks or teeth of the sea lion, fastened
    at the upper edge of the piece and this cloth is placed center of
    forehead, then back to the back of the head and tied, leaving the ends
    floating with the tusks sticking out in front. This head-gear is called
    cher-wer-ner, and the blankets are called cah-ane. This white deer-skin
    place is called Wah-tec and the village that sits just back of the
    dance place at the brow of the high flat, or bar, is of the same name.
    The Wah-tec village is north of the dancing place and just north of
    the village is the level flat where they play their stick game which
    is as rough as the white mans’ foot ball game. This game is called
    werlth-per and I have seen them pile in heaps at this game and many
    get hurt, there must be no fighting, yet they take a deceptive way of
    hurting one another if there is a dislike between them, just like the
    whites do. The white deer-skin dance at the end of ten days comes to an
    end at this place and the whole place is alive with Indians from all
    parts. Now the whole thing comes to a halt and all that are managing
    the dance return to their villages for more supplies. This stop is for
    one day only and now the stick game starts; and they may have several
    games between the up river and lower rivers, during the next few days.
    After the one day stop, so as to replenish provisions, they all start
    very early on the morning following and first go down the river from
    Wah-ker-ah about one mile to where a small creek enters into the river,
    this creek known as Bloxer Creek, but we call it Hel-le-gay-ow, this
    is on the north side of the river where this creek comes into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span> the
    river, now when they get to creek, they being on the south side and
    close to the entrance of the creek to the river, here all halt, this
    being where there are two trails, one goes down next to the river,
    crossing the creek and up to a small flat just at the foot of the hill,
    with the large pepperwood trees hanging it, is a place where the dance
    starts, and this trail and to this place, none can go unless they are
    born of the highest marriage. The girl and man that are of high birth
    have already gone and cleaned off the grounds, made the fire and are
    burning the incense. When the host arrives here they must give all
    their valuable articles that are to be used at this place, over to the
    poorest and shabby looking ones, if they have the right birth to take
    them over this piece of road or trail, to this place, Hel-le-gay-ow,
    and all from all parts know whether they have the birth, as this is
    kept close track of by the full blooded Klamath Indians. And if any
    persists or offers to go over this trail, to this place, they will be
    told very firmly to keep back and if needs be they will tell them that
    they are not born good enough to pass this way, but wait and go the
    other way. There has never been one of mixed blood of any part with the
    white man or any other mixture of blood, that they would let go this
    way. Only pure Klamath Indians are allowed. There was never a white
    man (ken-e-ah) that they would consent to let pass this way, for they
    did not know what kind of people the whites were and that the white
    marriages were not such as to give them the birth.</p>

  </div>

  <p>I can pass and have passed many times and have the training to know
    which can, and those that are not allowed, and the powerful in riches
    have to stop and take the upper trail, such as Pec-wan Colonel and
    Captain Sur-e-goine Jim and others whose wealth and influence that the
    white man thought would allow him to any part or place. I am one that
    knows that the birth is the one great event that gave to my people more
    honor, more power and more of everything in this life than all the
    riches in the whole world could buy. My people do not talk and tell of
    this for many reasons, they do not tell the white man thinking that
    they might wish to disobey the rule or right to stop them, and of all
    the white men that have married the Indian women, we do not think that
    a single one of them ever told their husband of this for the reason
    that they themselves did not have the birth to pass over this part of
    the trail, and was therefore ashamed to let their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span> men know that such
    was the case, and the white men thinking nothing of it stopped and did
    not notice that such was the case, it is kept from the mixed bloods
    where their fathers raised them in the same way, not even their own
    mothers telling them, ashamed for her children to know of her birth,
    and the mixed bloods that are raised among the Indians know that their
    birth does not admit them, so keep in their right place and are also
    ashamed to say anything about it, and so it has been kept until I told
    my husband, we being duly and truly married in the high marriage of
    my law and married in his law, my husband being a Free and Accepted
    Mason, how it was and for him to look and see for himself, but to stay
    back and that we would take the upper trail and go with the rich, the
    warrior and the throng that could not go the lower trail, where my
    father (A Talth) and sisters could and did go, yet they were poor and
    other that could go, there being few that could go while many went the
    way we did. This I never could have and which was very easy to see when
    once told and shown. Now after the Talth and them that have the birth,
    have done their dancing at this Hel-le-gay-ow, the girl and man slip
    out and go on up the hill through the timber into the other trail for a
    short distance and there clean off another place, make a small fire and
    place on it the incense to burn and the girl sits down in front when
    the dancers come following up and as they come into the trail.</p>

  <p>Now all the rich, the proud of all but their birth, comes in behind,
    and as they come up to the next dance place and form into line to
    dance, all can look on and see, soon this is done, and the same is done
    in two more places until the whole of them finally arrive at a large
    prairie that they call Bloxer, meaning wide in shape, as they come to
    the opening they cross a small branch and turn to a flat between two
    small branches or creeks that contain about two acres, at the foot of
    the raise from the flat is a large spring of cold, clear water flowing,
    here they halt for the final wind-up. They have been at this all day
    and the girl and the man (May-wa-lep) have the fires burning the
    incense, in the evening they dance, each one dances their turn, using
    here the white deer-skins and all of the finest of their regalia and
    valuables, after the dance is over they have their supper and retire,
    tired out. Early the next morning all is astir and they dance the five
    dances in the forenoon and eat dinner in the after part of the day.
    The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span> last and final dance is to come when this is finished late in the
    night, about nine o’clock, then all take their meal, when many of them
    depart and the great White Deer-Skin Dance is closed for two years
    at least, or maybe more, and all go home. Now when we speak of the
    dance being closed for two years or more, we mean by this of the old
    and ancient laws, by which it was conducted, for it has already been
    carried through in a spurious or farcical way by them that are of low
    birth, not having a single one that was a Talth to take the lead and
    carry it through in proper form, but the white man sees it and does
    not know the difference.</p>

  <p>Those of high birth come to the remaining Talth to ask a few questions
    while the Talth answers them in a smooth tone of voice, which is their
    gift and lets it pass on in quiet, knowing that it is forever done.
    The Talth that now live make only one last request of the living, that
    is, that when they come to give up this life, that before they are
    laid away, when being prepared for burial, that the emblem or mark of
    the Talth be placed on them. This is four black stripes placed on the
    breast eight inches in length, one half inch wide and one inch apart,
    and on each arm between the shoulders and elbow, there is to be three
    stripes four inches long, same width and one inch apart, which are the
    marks or emblem of the Talth.</p>

  <p>When they are prepared for the last resting place, the grave, and these
    emblems or marks are never put on any of them unless they have been put
    through the secrets of the Lodge, and carry in their breast that true
    name of Wah-pec-wah-mow, (God) there are only two of these left, one is
    myself and the other my father. This chapter now closes and we take up
    the greatest of all, the Lodge dance, (Wah-neck-way-la-gaw) called by
    the whites by many different names.</p>

  <div class="subhead">THE LODGE DANCE.</div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE white man calls this dance the jump dance and this has caused
    the Indians to call it thus when they speak of it in the white mans
    tongue, but we call in our language Wah-neck-wel-la-gaw, and which has
    no meaning as to a dance. This dance is held at the Pec-wan village,
    and it is about one mile up the river from where the “White Deer-Skin
    Dance” is held. This festival is held one year after the White Deer
    Skin Dance, or is held alternately. This is the most sacred festival
    that we have, and like the fish dam, we start preparations for the
    festival some two months ahead and all differences and disputes are
    settled before this starts. If there are any who can not or will not
    settle, they must not come to see or take part in the festival, and by
    this the reader can see that this once powerful and numerous tribe of
    Indians, by making these complete settlements among all of their people
    once a year, one year for the Fish Dam and the next year the Lodge
    Dance. And could be managed by the High Priests and be well governed
    without the aid of a chief, as they never had a chief. The Pec-wan
    village was in olden times a very large and wealthy village. This is
    where the lodge of the lower Klamaths is situated, and this lodge and
    the house where all the tools of the Talth are kept, is the only one
    now at this writing left of the whole tribe. In the times when the
    white man first came there was one of these lodges at Big Lagoon, which
    we call Ah-ca-tah, and one at the mouth of Redwood Creek which we call
    Orick, one at the mouth of Klamath River which we call Reck-woy, and
    one at Pec-wan. Four of these lodges belonging to the lower division
    of the Klamath River, and the upper rivers had a number of lodges, but
    there is not one of them left. There are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span> no Indians left to tell of
    them, or how and what they were used for, so making it at are time only
    one that is left, and only two of the Talth are left to tell of the use
    and meaning of the grand good that come from them to the proud people.
    When all is ready the three Talth start very early in the morning and
    select the timbers for putting up a complete new frame of the lodge,
    not leaving a single piece of the wood-work of the old lodge, but
    replacing it with new. Upon their return from selecting the timbers the
    Talth then go into the house, where the tools are kept and take them
    out. Those that are used for getting post and the frame with all the
    sidings, they put these in a very nicely knit sack which is made of
    good and lasting material and kept for this purpose, then they take
    it on the outside of the house and leave it there for the night. Now
    the Talth return to their homes and family, always bathing themselves,
    for they are as near perfect in their cleanliness as it is given human
    being to be. They go into their homes with smiles for their wives and
    children, and all others that they may come in touch with. These Talth
    are very firm in their manners, very witty in jokes, but slow to speak
    in matters of decision. After supper they retire to their sweat-house
    to sleep. There they first take a smoke and then go to sleep. Now the
    ones that are the workers have already been selected for getting out
    the material to put up the wood part of the lodge, and the whole of
    the work must be done in one day. Every piece is made to fit in its
    place, where it is gotten out in the woods, so that when it is brought
    in, which is done the same day, all fits into its place. The whole
    structure is set up without the use of tools; no noise and no words are
    spoken, only by the three Talth, and by them only in a low voice.</p>

  <p>Those that work to get out these timbers must all be of good birth,
    not necessarily of the highest birth, but of good birth of the wealthy
    and well-to-do class. Some of the ones of the highest births are not
    considered to be of the right minds, with good behavior to be made a
    Talth. No one of the low births or slaves are allowed to take part in
    the making of the old lodge, Talth-ur-girk. We have degrees in this
    lodge work, some are allowed to go in and learn a small part of it and
    are never given any more, while other are allowed to learn a greater
    part, and they are never given the true name of God.</p>

  <p>This highest marriage takes twelve strings of cheek, twelve pieces
    to each string, and out of the few marriages there was very few that
    was good to be made a Talth, and by this they were compelled to choose
    from the girls as well as the boys. The ones that were right for the
    Talth, to keep from loosing the workings of the order, as well as to
    keep the sacred name of God from being lost. If through famine or
    epidemic it would be lost in some of the places or lodges, they could
    get some that were Talth to come from Ah-ca-tah, Orick, Reck-woy or
    from some of the lodges from the Pech-ic-las, so that they could fix up
    the lodges and take some of the ones of the right birth and initiate
    in to the secret workings of the order, and make them Talth, and build
    the order up again. These things have happened many times in there long
    history and occupation of this land. Now all the old lumber that is
    taken from the lodge when it is to be made anew, is taken to the house
    which the Talth use for there preparations, and to keep the working
    tools in, and there it is used to renew the weak parts, and the rest is
    used for fire wood in this house, so that none of it is wasted.</p>

  <p>The dance, after everything is fixed and all in readiness, will last
    for ten days, and when all is ready the Talth and all the workers,
    which are called Wer-ner-ger-ee, go to their different homes or friends
    and eat their supper, and after this is finished, all the workers with
    two of the Talth go out and gather wood, which is the small limbs and
    twigs of the huckleberry, which we make use of by keeping a small fire
    through the night in the lodge, and on the fire we burn incense roots
    which give off a pleasant odor. Now the other Talth, who is the master
    of the ceremonies, goes straight from the house to the lodge, and with
    him the one, or the two girls. These girl are not always a Talth, but
    sometimes one of them is and has the whole secrets of the order, even
    to the real name of God. These girls must be born of the highest birth
    to even help. The master, when he goes in, talks or prays while the
    girl or girls sweep it and place things in shape, which keeps them
    busy, if there is only one girl, she does not have time to leave the
    lodge. About nine o’clock the Talth with all the workers come out in
    line, single file, with a bunch of wood, each one with his bundle on
    his shoulder, all singing, and this in the night or evening sounds most
    beautiful, as it is most perfect in time and tune and makes one feel
    the love for the great Creator of all things.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span></p>

  <p>When they arrive with the wood, all lay in around the top of the house
    or lodge, then either one of the two Talth takes some inside of the
    lodge and makes a small fire inside. The floor of the lodge is made of
    marble, and they have a large bowl made of marble in which is placed
    clean, pure water, and in this water is placed the roots walth-pay. Now
    when the time is ready, all will come inside of the lodge and bath in
    the marble bowl with the walth-pay in it. This bowl is kept secreted
    and only the Talth knows where it is; the master of the lodge has taken
    the bowl out from its hiding place and put it in its proper place,
    and put the water and walth-pay roots in it. Now when the workers and
    the two Talth comes with the wood and after the fire is started, the
    two Talth remain and all the others go outside, and the three Talth
    bath themselves, also the one or two girls, as the case maybe. If one
    of them is not a Talth then she too has to go outside. Then the Talth
    go through all the secret part of the work in the lodge, while the
    girl that is a Talth remains inside of the lodge, and takes part in
    the secret workings. The lodge is now opened, and all the workers are
    invited to come inside. Some of the workers are Talth, sometimes nearly
    all of them, if not, they are high born. They all wash themselves in
    the marble bowl and all have the Indian comb, the men’s being longer
    than the ones the girls have. After washing, each one washes and combs
    their hair until it is clean and glossy, leaving the hair hang down
    loosely, using the combs to stroke the hair back, and careful not to
    touch it with their hands.</p>

  <p>The men are perfectly naked, while the girls have a maple bark dress
    fastened around the waist, hanging down to the knees, otherwise they
    were nude. Now the master takes his place in the south-east corner of
    the lodge, sitting on his Indian chair and in his hand he holds his
    staff, or rod, which is the stalk of the walth-pay. This staff is the
    stalk which grows from the herb or root that God made women from in
    the first creation, and the staff is so old that it is black with age.
    The next one in authority sits in the north-east corner of the lodge,
    while the third one sits in the north-west corner of the lodge. The
    lodge sits north and south, the entrance is at the south end, the west
    side being left dark. The Master in managing the ceremonies, has a
    helper (this was my part and the emblem I wear is the Dove) who sits
    on the right hand side of the Master, and if there is no girl that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span> is
    a Talth, then a man that is a Talth has to fill the place, and this
    one has to place and move the chair of the Master as he rises and
    sits down, and if there is only one girl, then she has to preform a
    double duty of removing and placing the chairs of all three officers
    of the lodge, and when this happens is keep her on the move all night
    until five o’clock in the morning; when she comes out very tired, yet
    light hearted and very proud of her birth, her standing and the great
    knowledge she has of the secret history of her people. Very few there
    be that has ever been admitted to her high plane, and none has ever
    excelled her. She knows that she and all the other Talth are full
    blooded Klamath, and no mixture of any other blood in their veins. This
    secret organization dates back to the very beginning of God’s creation
    of man and woman, as this staff of the walth-pay is what God made woman
    out of. This walth-pay they have preserved in this land in selected
    places and it still grows here, and we still use it in all of our
    secret work. It only grows in a few places, and all of us know where to
    find it. They brought this with them, from the old land, and on down
    through the ages to commemorate the first creation of woman.</p>

  <p>I have offered to go to the lodge and teach one or more when there was
    enough of the Talth left to do so, but now there are none left, and
    they could not pick out a girl that was eligible to give it to, until
    now there is no chance left, and what ever is done towards the meeting
    of this old and ancient order is only a farce, and done by the low
    births, the low class and the slave class. When I first told my father
    that I was going to marry a white man, my people objected, saying that
    if I had children they could not be admitted to the order. It was then
    I told them to select one that I might teach the secret part of the
    lodge to. It is sad for me to write of the inside working of the lodge,
    and who can blame me. My people are passing away, being absorbed by the
    white race.</p>

  <p>Now all are inside of the lodge and they give the whole night to
    chanting and praying to God, to please the Creator, to give them
    health, wealth and to watch over them, keeping them safe from disease.
    They keep this up until about five o’clock in the morning and then they
    all go down to the house where the dance is to be held, and this house
    is called Ah-pure-way. They build a small fire and place some roots on
    it. Now during this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span> time the wealthy families have moved from their
    homes, bring their wives sisters and daughters to cook and prepare food.</p>

  <p>The first dance is hurriedly gotten ready and then the dancers come up
    to the house, going in and taking their places. The dance starts and
    will last for ten days. As soon as the first dance is over the Talth
    go to their homes to eat and rest, and the tired but proud little girl
    goes to her home and eats, after which she takes a much needed sleep.
    All have bathed, which they never fail to do, and dressed their hair
    and combed it cleanly. There are five villages that take part in the
    Po-lick-las dance, being the same ones that took part in the White Deer
    Skin Dance. All Indians are invited to come, rich or poor, from any
    and all tribes, from far off and near by. Far away tribes are looked
    after, fed and asked to take part in the dance, even if they cannot
    speak their language. They will motion to them and show them how and
    give them full protection at all times and under any circumstances, so
    that they may enjoy it to the fullest. This is the time that the very
    poor and slave class of our own people are made jolly and contented,
    proud to be known and called a Klamath Indian. They are here allowed,
    both men and women, to put in whatever they may possess that is of
    value, that is used to dance with. The wealthy ones that own lands,
    hunting territory, fishing places, slaves, flints, white deer-skins,
    fisher skins, otter skins, silver gray fox skins and fine dresses made
    of dressed deer skins, with fringes or shells knotted and worked in the
    most beautiful styles, that clink and jingle as they walk and makes one
    have a feeling of respect and admiration for them. The eyes will strain
    to look on this most pleasant sight, which can never leave one’s memory
    that has seen it in its flowery days.</p>

  <p>They take the scalp of the woodpecker, which they sew together from
    sixty to one hundred in number, on a piece of nicely dressed buck skin,
    the edges also being buck skin, it looks like a plug hat. They let the
    ends hang as streamers at the back of the head. These are valued at
    from one to two hundred dollars, having red and white fringes, which
    makes them look very pretty. These head dresses are called Rah-gay and
    the scalps are called cheese, whether one or many of them. They have
    great strings of the long hollow shells, called cheek and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span> turk-tum,
    around their necks, hanging down over the breasts to the waist. This,
    the most sacred of all their festivals, is held in a house and more of
    their wealth is displayed at this time than on any other occasion. The
    wealth of the whole tribe of the Klamath Indians, even the Hoopas and
    Smith River, and any other tribe can put in and help in this dance.
    Here in this dance the rich ones will turn over to the poorest of them
    their display of wealth and go away, leaving it in their care, our
    people do not use feathers but very little, less than the white people.</p>

  <p>In the evening of the second days dancing, the Talth go back to the
    lodge and the Master with the girl who is a Talth, go into the lodge,
    and the Master puts fresh clean water into the bowl, pounds and places
    the walth-pay roots into it and it is ready for use. The other girls
    remaining in the preparation house or goes to other parts to preform
    when they have things fixed for them. The Master gives prayers to God
    while the other two Talth in authority will take the same ones, the
    workers, and go out for more wood, the same as the first time, coming
    in about nine o’clock, all in single file, led by the two Talth singing
    the song as they come and place the wood the same as before. Now the
    two Talth go inside and the lodge is opened, the Talth girl helping
    until all is in readiness, then the workers are called in and the Talth
    each take their place, the Master with his staff of the walth-pay, and
    the girl in her place by the Master and the workings of the lodge are
    gone through with as before, and kept up all night until five o’clock
    in the morning, when they come out and go to their homes and camps to
    eat. Now the dancers take up the dancing and the whole thing moves
    along smoothly, without a thing to mar the good times. The Talth do not
    take any part in the dancing, and are but seldom seen to take a look at
    it, and the Master does not come to see any part of it, but if he does,
    he just passes on, laughing joking and jesting with all the men and
    women and they are more than glad to see him.</p>

  <p>The Talth call each other brothers, and the girls sisters, and the word
    brother and sister is used a great deal among these people.</p>

  <p>When the lodge is working in its secret part of the order, there is a
    guard stationed at the door on the outside to keep others from hearing
    or entering. In the evening of every second<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span> day they open the lodge
    until the dance has run for eight days, when they open the lodge in the
    same way, in the evening for the fifth and last time. The Master and
    the girl go into the lodge, while the two Talth and the workers go and
    get the wood, coming back at nine o’clock, then the same performance
    is gone through with, ending about five o’clock in the morning, then
    all the worker are expelled from the lodge and go to the dance house
    and make the fire, burn the incense roots, sweep and clean the house
    for the last two days of the festival. The three Talth and the girl
    remain in the lodge and finish the winding up ceremonies of the lodge
    for the dance, after which the bowl, staff and other emblems and tools
    are placed in their secret hiding places so that them who are Talth
    know where to find them, then they come out and go to their homes to
    eat, sleep and rest. Now the last two days of the dance commences,
    and the finest of dresses and the most valuable of articles are used,
    all the riches are brought out, showing which are the most wealthy of
    family, some of which have long records dating back for generations,
    telling how the family first started in prominence, and up to the
    present time.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span> This festival is held for the purpose and equality of
    the whole people together, the rich, the poor and the slave, make
    themselves come together in peace and harmony as one family and to make
    the poor and the slave feel that there is some good to live for, and
    more and above all to make them warriors, that none dare scorn. That
    if any other tribe dare to violate the laws of humanity, such as to
    mutilate the dead by scalping and other ways, which the Klamaths would
    not tolerate for a moment, and by the Talth to keep and preserve their
    old and ancient teachings of the sacred order which has been handed
    down to them through the ages, which they say has never been, through
    it all, down to where it is now. They say that a number of times it
    has been low, yet there was enough to revive and bring it back to its
    proper place, so as not to loose it in its secret parts and keep it up.
    At the end of ten days the dance, late in the evening closes and the
    people scatter in all directions, while the rich families, that have so
    many women to help in preparing the food, and some with children, and
    so much wealth to move, will keep their camp open until the next day,
    and some for two days longer, until they can get everything ready for
    moving home.</p>

  <div class="subhead">OUR CHRIST.</div>

  <p class="drop-cap">A&nbsp; YOUNG woman of the Pech-ic-la’s, the upper division of the Klamath
    tribe, lived at Caw-ah-man, now known as Orleans Bar. She was the
    mother of Po-lich-o-quare-ick, our Christ, and never married after the
    birth of her son, and lived single all her life, residing with her
    folks at Orleans Bar. Caw-ah-mis-o-ma, the mother of our Christ, during
    the years of her womanhood, would go alone daily to a high rock, not
    heeding the remonstrances of her parents and kindred, and would ascend
    the sides of this rock to its top, where she would seat herself and
    weave baskets every day. She went alone every day for nearly three
    years to this rock and made baskets, and one day Wah-pec-wah-mow (God)
    appeared to her and said that she would bear him a male child, which
    would be His Son, and this Son would be our Christ, or Savior, who
    would be a very wise and talented man of the two tribes and would rule
    our people.</p>

  <p>Upon reaching her home that evening she told her parents and the people
    of the tribes that she soon would give birth to the Son of God, that
    God himself, having appeared before her, made facts known to her, and
    that she should not be looked upon in disgrace by her people. Her
    parents and a great many of the people of the Klamath tribes believed
    her story to be true and they made ready to receive the Child.</p>

  <p>Caw-ah-mis-o-ma gave birth to a son as she had said, and cared for the
    infant in her father’s home, giving it the name of Po-lick-o-quare-ick,
    proclaiming the child to the tribes as the Son of God. Her parents and
    a great many of the people of the tribe believed in the infallibility
    of the child, while a number of the people did not believe in him as
    infallible, and regarded him as a bastard child. Some of our Talth, or
    High Priests, did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span> believe in his divine birth and considered him
    as the bastard son of man, however, they recognized his great powers
    and wisdom as an ordinary man. Most of my people worshiped the child as
    divine.</p>

  <p>During the childhood and boyhood years of Po-lick-o-quare-ick he sought
    the solitudes of a great creation, as he never played with other
    children, and never mingled in the social gatherings of his people.
    As a little child he played alone, and when he had reached the age of
    about two years, he had a little canoe that he would play with and sail
    it in the waters at Orleans Bar. This little toy boat was one of his
    earliest playthings, and when he left his early childhood scenes he
    left this boat at Orleans Bar on the south bank of the river in a rift
    or crevice of a large rock. There, to this day the Indians say you can
    see the little boat that he played with and which has turned into a
    solid stone, and is still the perfect shape of a small boat. (This I
    have not seen).</p>

  <p>While yet a small boy of tender years, Po-lick-o-quare-ick came down to
    the river to Ca-neck, alone, where he spent a great deal of his early
    boyhood years in restless wandering, as he was never still. He would
    never go with his mother, or with any one else as he went from place
    to place alone. On the south side of the river at Ca-neck is a small
    lake at the foot of the hill back from the river, and is surrounded
    on the outer banks by marshy lands. This lake cannot be observed from
    the river or village, and its existence might never be known except by
    coming upon its very banks. He spent a great deal of his time playing
    in his solitary ways about the lake. Just back of this lake is a rock
    that our Christ used as a place where he would continually be sliding
    down its side, he wore away one large and some small groove with his
    heels, in this solid stone, which can be seen to this day. (This I have
    seen many times and my people rub their fingers on these grooves and
    then rub the fingers on their eyes, to cure weak or sore eyes.) About
    half a mile below the lake, located on the same side of the river, is
    another rock, where the young man went for prayers which he offered up
    to his father, (God) to bless him with great powers and wisdom. As he
    knelt at the top of this rock in prayer he left the sunken imprint of
    his knees and feet in the rock, which is still visible.</p>

  <p>Another rock concerning our Christ is located a short distance above
    the lake on the bank of river, which was his special<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span> fishing place,
    where he would sit on the rock and fish. Here also in the solid stone
    is the sunken imprint of his bare feet and knees, and also the pool
    of water, close by, that he cast his fish in; all of which are left
    as his written memoirs of his past existence. These are his written
    annals left upon the rocks; the traditions handed down through the
    long centuries when the Christ himself had passed away, far out on the
    ocean waves, perchance to a better land than that, which had given him
    birth. (This place I have been close to many times, yet I never went
    to see it.) He could speak the language of any tribe or nation without
    teaching, and could peer into the darkness of the past, telling the
    events of bygone times. He could gaze into the future and tell of the
    events to be, so great was his wisdom; he could also command anything
    he wanted, and his commands would be answered, to his every wish.</p>

  <p>When he was in the prime of his years he took a lot of valuable things,
    such as cheek, cheese (the scalp of the woodcock) and other things, got
    into his canoe and started down the river and when he arrived where
    Bill McGarvey’s store afterwards was built, he stopped and took a rest
    in the early morning sunshine. This is the reason this place is the
    warmest and most sunny the year round, that is to be found in any part
    of our whole territory. After resting as long as he wished he started
    on down the river. Many of the Indians followed after him, and as they
    were crowding quite close he commanded that an opening be made through
    the rock bluff at Reck-woy, which was done and this turned the Klamath
    river into the ocean at that place, some six miles south of where it
    went into the sea before, at Ah-man. (Wilson Creek) Thus they never
    caught up to him but could see out in the ocean, gliding gently on
    towards the west. He had previously told them that he was ready to go
    and was going, that in some future time he would come back. He was the
    wisest man that we have ever had among our people, he knew all things
    and could do all things and we hold his name with great reverence. It
    is the custom of our young women to use the expression; “when we get
    married and if we have children, we wish they can talk all languages
    like Po-lick-o-quare-ick.” My people for many generations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span> look for
    him to come back, but since the coming of the Ken-ne-ah’s, the white
    people, they are losing trace of his name and the things that he did,
    and it will soon be lost. It is now my desire, after many years of
    thinking, to write it all out so it may be preserved for the American
    Indians, that they may know something of the religion and teachings of
    our forefathers.</p>

  <div class="subhead">THE SAMPSON OF THE KLAMATH INDIANS.</div>

  <p class="drop-cap">KAY-KAY-MY-ALTH-MAY, the Sampson of the Po-lick-la’s, (the lower
    Klamath Indians) and the Pech-ic-la’s (upper Klamath Indians), was born
    at the village of Auh-leek-kin on the river. This village is about
    twelve miles down the river from the old Klamath Bluffs store, and
    about the same distance from the mouth of the river at Requa. It was
    once a large and flourishing village, a long time ago at the time of
    Sampson’s birth, and long after he was dead.</p>

  <p>This Indian Sampson was a tall and handsome fellow, with sinewy arms
    and a body of muscle. His hair was extremely long, such flowing tresses
    of beauty and strength, wherein his wonderful physical powers lay.
    This man of wonderful physique was a Klamath Indian, a lone and mighty
    warrior for all who opposed him; and it mattered little how many in
    number were against him, they were always defeated. This warrior did
    not use bow and arrows, spears or shields to defend himself in his
    conquests, but used instead the sling and pebbles. He would raid whole
    villages in the quest of wealth and none dared combat him but what were
    defeated. The tribes feared him for his great strength, as they knew
    not where he got his super-natural power.</p>

  <p>The tribes of the Smith River, Hoopa and Klamath feared him greatly
    as he reached the dizzy heights of his powers and massacres. He
    refused to pay tribute to any of the tribes.</p>

  <p>One day this warrior bold, emboldened by his triumphs, met a beautiful
    and shy maiden of another tribe, with whom he fell desperately in love.
    Her people were the Smith River tribe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span> (He-na’s) with whom he was
    fighting at the time. He defeated them and took her captive, and alas,
    love after a time proved his utter ruin. Ah, what monarch of earth
    that love will not conquer with her soothing hands! After he captured
    the maiden he married her so she could hold herself respected before
    all, and took her to his home at Auh-leek-kin, giving her the name of
    Auh-leek-kin-on. No children came to bless this union; no childish
    prattle or laughter to lift the gloom of the coming years.</p>

  <p>This Sampson’s dwelling place was in a house where he had made a
    cellar in the clay and in this cellar he always retreated at night
    that he might not be suddenly surprised and taken by his enemies. His
    wife yielded to his love, seeking the secret of his great strength,
    and alas, mighty man and warrior, the conqueror of tribes fell before
    the weak hands of the woman he loved. Day by day, so gentle and sweet
    her endearing words of affection fell like balm on his troubled soul,
    soothing the afflictions of a dark and turbulent career. Patiently as
    the months past by she gained his confidence. Ah, ’tis sweet to yield
    to woman’s wiles, though she leads you to the grave, yawning with the
    grim jaws of death. In this woman’s feeble arms, this powerful man
    revealed his secret, that his mighty strength was in his long and
    flowing hair, the beauty of night and the strength of nations.</p>

  <p>False woman came to dwell in his life as she gained the secrets of
    his mighty powers; siren like was the touch of her fingers upon his
    troubled forehead. Fascinated in the comfort of one he loved so
    passionately he fell asleep, and one fatal day with his head laid
    lovingly upon her lap, the cruel woman of destiny arose stealthily and
    stole from the fire embers a flaming torch and burnt the raven locks
    off closely to his head, as he slept soundly on.</p>

  <p>Upon awakening, to his great alarm and grief, he found that his
    super-human strength had left him. The pride of his life, his long and
    flowing locks were gone, and with it his fate was sealed. The powerful
    warrior lay vanquished at the feet of his enemies, to grieve his loss
    as only great men can grieve.</p>

  <p>After his enemies had captured him they decided to put out his eyes
    that he might never more be able to fight them.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span> Thus, at last, the
    great and strong Kay-kay-my-alth-may was defeated by the weak hands of
    a woman he had loved and trusted so much.</p>

  <p>After he had been captured and tortured, his proud spirit gave grief so
    intense that only a great physical strength could long endure. He lived
    a few short years, in his native village, but the time seemed long in
    his blindness. He could no longer behold the splendors of the sunrise
    on the mountain tops or the splendors of the sunset on yon Pacific
    Ocean. The wunderlust of his life had set in dismal gloom as he pined
    away and died of a broken heart. His faithless wife returned to her
    people, where she also died, leaving no one to mourn her and only the
    memory of his great strength.</p>

  <div class="subhead">THE DELUGE OF THE KLAMATH INDIANS.</div>

  <p class="drop-cap">IT has been handed down from long ago that the people became so wicked,
    no good was found in anything, and human progress retrograded into
    destruction. Unwedded women became the mothers of a host of bastard
    children as the men led a life of debauchery, and the women a life of
    shame. Crimes and murders lurked in every corner, plunder and the greed
    for riches followed each other in a terrible way. Men sought not honest
    lives, but sought the greed and plunder of riches. Those who commanded
    their self-respect and cherished their family pride became few and far
    between. Profane language became the rule, laws became corrupt and
    unheeded, and whole communities swerved downward in utter ruination.</p>

  <p>God became angry upon looking down, He saw the people growing more
    corrupt, year by year, where human beings eked out a miserable
    existence in their greed. God appeared to one of the good men,
    (a Talth) a man who had always lived an honest and upright life,
    respecting his fellow men, and observed above all, God’s moral laws. He
    appeared to this man, Gus-so-me, who possessed in his secret breast the
    true name of God, and God said unto him that He was going to destroy
    everything on earth with a great flood, as the people had become so
    wicked that He would no longer endure the sights of such wickedness.
    Gus-so-me pleaded with God not to destroy the people by flooding the
    world, and God then told him to go forth among the people and see how
    many good ones he could find, he could find but one more, so God told
    him to prepare a raft, as He was going to destroy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span> the world with a
    flood. This one man that had the abiding faith of an honorable man
    was Haw-gon-ow, also a Talth. God now appeared before their two High
    Priests and bade them prepare for the final deluge as there was no good
    people to be found on earth, except the two Talth and their wives. He
    bade them to build a large raft upon which they would float while the
    rest of the creation would sink beneath the rising waters and perish.</p>

  <p>Gus-so-me and the Haw-gon-ow began at once to build the raft, (men-up)
    while the people continued in their wild revelries, jeering in contempt
    at the two builders, but they heeded them not and worked steadily on.
    When the two Talth completed the raft He caused it to begin raining,
    and it rained steadily, causing the waters to rise higher and higher,
    until the o-plah-peck (flood) waters covered the entire world. When
    the waters came up around the raft the two Talth took their wives,
    Ger-ke-er and Ca-wa-mer onto the raft, where they remained and floated
    upward as the water rose. These two wives were also Talth, and our holy
    order was kept intact over the great deluge. They carried with them
    upon the raft, the herb, or walth-pay, which as before kept perfectly
    green and bloomed, they also took with them the raven and the dove, but
    all the other species of the earth were left, and they were destroyed
    in the great flood. It rained steadily for many days and nights upon
    a terror stricken world, until all the valleys and lowlands were one
    continuous sea, and only tops of the highest hills and mountains
    remained uncovered, where the people stood huddled together, as they
    had been steadily driven up the mountain sides by the water. And still
    it continued to rain, the people running hither and thither, piercing
    wails went up as the terrible apprehension of destruction was upon
    them, their piteous cries were only answered by the rising waters as
    their bodies were tossed a moment upon the angry waves and then sank
    to their graves in the unknown depths. Soon all the highest mountain
    peaks were covered with water and the world was one continuous sea. All
    living creatures had perished from the earth, as they had sank beneath
    the waves to live no more.</p>

  <p>When the rain stopped, Gus-so-me sent the raven (bua-gawk) forth from
    the raft to see if it could bring any tidings of dry land. He flew away
    over the waters until he found some dead fish and never returned. This
    is the reason the raven ever since has lived on carrion and always
    remained so wild, inhabiting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span> the far off crags of the mountains that
    command a view of the surrounding country, so they can see any one
    approaching, and fly away. After a few days had passed and no tidings
    of the raven came, Gus-so-me sent forth the dove, (aw-rah-way) and
    after it was gone a short time, it returned to the raft with a twig of
    the pepperwood. Gus-so-me now knew that the waters on which he floated
    were going back, and soon there would be dry land, and from that time
    on, the Indians have had a great reverence for the dove. We carry the
    symbol of the dove in our sacred lodge, and teach the children from
    childhood never to harm the dove, and we never harm it in any way.</p>

  <p>After the return of the dove the raft floated on the waters for a few
    days longer and finally rested on the top of a very high mountain,
    known as Ne-gam-alth, which is located in the far north-east on this
    continent and not across the ocean. This lofty peak glistens in the
    sunlight and can be seen from a great distance. The raft as it rested
    on this mountain, turned to white flint, and when the sun shines this
    flint glistens brightly. In our traditions only one man has ever
    climbed this mountain and returned to our people since the flood,
    bringing with him a piece of the flint, and since this time we have
    used the white flint at our festivals, it being the most valuable of
    all other kinds.</p>

  <p>When the waters went down sufficiently, God commanded Gus-so-me
    and Haw-gon-ow, with their wives, to go down from the mountain and
    re-populate the earth. From these two Talth and their wives came our
    present people, and they again scattered over the continent. In coming
    down from the mountain top the Talth carried with them the walth-pay,
    the same as they did when they first made their long journey from the
    land of Cheek-cheek-alth. This divine herb bloomed perpetually again,
    and Gus-so-me, with the assistance of Haw-gon-ow, in using the correct
    words of their prayer to God, could command with the herb anything they
    needed for human existence, as their prayers would be granted by God.</p>

  <p>God now created the animal and plant life that was destroyed during
    the flood, with the exception of the raven and the dove, which the
    High Priests carried with them upon the raft. When the re-creation was
    made, God first made the white deer, then the red eagle, the same as
    in the first creation. He also placed the rain bow in the heavens as a
    promise to Gus-so-me and Haw-gon-ow,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span> that he would never again destroy
    the people by flood, but if the people ever become so corrupt again
    He would destroy them with a great fire burning the world. When the
    Indians see the rainbow in the heavens, they always look upon it with
    the assurance that it is the promise of God, that He will destroy the
    world no more with rain. When the heavy rains fall they always say that
    it will not continue to rain very long, for the next time all the world
    will pass away in flames.</p>

  <p>The Talth bring down the traditions that when they first arrived in
    this land, the white race which they found here were a highly moral
    race. They lived in peace and happiness and crimes were things unknown.
    With the passing of this white race, passed the age of innocence and
    peace.</p>

  <p>Upon the arrival of the present white race, the Indians first
    believed that it was the ancient white people returning. The tribes
    rejoiced as they thought peace and happiness would reign again, for
    the Wa-gas had given them their faithful promise that they would
    some day return. Alas, the sad mistaken identity of these people for
    they were foreigners who took advantage of our hospitality, and soon
    wanted to claim the land of our forefathers. Crimes followed in their
    footsteps of extermination, together with race hatred has covered
    nearly sixty-five years of their annals. Worse than the shot and
    shell, it brought the pride of our race to their graves long ago. The
    introduction of whiskey brought desolation and ruin upon us, without an
    example story to tell. They ruined the splendid morals of our women,
    and led them to prostitution, which they had never known since the
    re-creation of our kingdom. They filled their bodies with loathsome
    disease that we had never known since the world began, and our Indian
    doctors gave up in despair for they could not find any cure for these
    diseases. When our loyal good men rose up and remonstrated against
    these outrages, these foreign white men were wont to abuse us and call
    us savages, and sent some of the tribes away to distant reservations to
    starve and die. They called our women “Squaws”, and our men “Bucks”. It
    seems they had an idea that we did not possess human souls, cherished
    with the human love of devotion. They claimed our lands and their
    historians termed us as, “the wild denizens of the forest,” as if
    we were foreigners in the remote ages of a vast antiquity. Fortune
    seekers, gamblers and cut-throats lived with our women in adultery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
    until they grew weary of them and left them with children. Poor little
    children of their own flesh and blood, children without a birth and
    without a parent to legalize them as his own. The fathers of the animal
    kingdom are proud to fight for their young and will not abandon them,
    even in the jaws of death. Can such a class of people as this have a
    soul, when they have committed such outrages upon my people and have
    disgraced the living by their deeds? The origin of our race was proud,
    the proudest that ever walked the earth, and when these children find
    their pride forever robbed by no fault of their own, their proud
    hearts break down in the sorrowful years that follow, as their fallen
    parentage leads them to unhonored graves. Such sorrowful processions
    as these follow each other under the gloom of oppression. I have today
    looked among my tribe of the Po-lick-la’s and the Pech-ic-la’s and am
    deeply grieved to find but very few babies born of good pure blood,
    that is not tainted with the virus of venereal diseases. Where do these
    pathetic conditions arise? We are reluctant to point again to the
    white man. In some instances a large family of brothers and sisters do
    not know their true relationship. I dare say, perhaps each one came
    from a different father, and the father comes from God knows where,
    and has gone they know not where, but such a father will undoubtedly
    answer at the Throne of the Almighty God. I pray that God may have
    mercy upon such children who are left to suffer the disgrace of an
    unworthy parent. Today where the Klamath rears its regal monarchs of
    the forests, where it rears its lofty mountain peaks from its rugged
    shores, and mingles its waters with the Pacific Ocean, this glorious
    country once in its beauty and pride, I have scanned its hostage and
    find not one, whose birth will admit them to that holy lodge, not
    one who can burn its sacred fires at the sacred alter. The Talth are
    waiting ever, for no more will answer their piteous pleadings, to save
    and cherish a sublime religion. A precious few of the middle aged have
    the birth, but their morals in a larger sense, have been corrupted,
    their integrity has been undermined until they think a promise broken
    is better than a promise kept, therefore, while the world lasts they
    can never be admitted to this sacred lodge. Some of the ken-ne-ah men
    have been honest enough to wed our women under their laws, and some of
    them have married under both the white man’s and the Indian’s marriage
    laws. Most of these men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span> have brought up large families, and the
    children from these unions, on an average, make men and women that the
    American nation might well be proud of.</p>

  <p>The High Priests say today, that from their ancient teachings, and
    their ancient religion, that the corruption of the ken-ne-ah’s (whites)
    among themselves, and the demoralization of their own race, that the
    two races are becoming very wicked. Men and women alike use profane
    languages, men debauch their women into prostitution, the whiskey and
    wine from the saloons pierce the hearts of young men and women alike,
    breaking up the ties of peaceful homes, and tearing asunder the love
    of human hearts, thus leaving desolation as it goes on. The greed for
    riches by trickery and deception in general leads the Talth to believe
    very strongly, that ere long God will send the great conflagration that
    will consume all the world in flames, and that its people will pass
    away. Over their ashes God will create another people, where they will
    build their stately mansions, of the soul unto God. Over the ashes of
    the obliterated ages, will prosper a new people with new governments,
    and new laws, and the ages of peace and happiness will dawn again,
    shedding its radiance of glory over the entire world. Thus have
    prophesied our High Priests.</p>

  <div class="subhead">THE HIGH PRIESTS.</div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE Talth are born under the highest marriages, and there has been
    at no time but very few of them, on account of the scarcity of cheek
    (money) to make the marriage. There had to be twelve pieces to make
    one string, (caw-ton-a) they count them only as ten pieces, and it
    makes twelve strings, so that when it is counted there will be one
    hundred and forty-four pieces. The woman that a Talth may marry does
    not have to be of a Talth family, but can be born of the middle or
    wealthy class. Her people can match back, or nearly so, in valuable
    articles for the twelve strings of cheek, that he gives. Under such a
    marriage as this there may be several children. Now if the mother and
    father are full blooded Klamath Indians, then their children are of
    the right birth, yet there may be one, and perhaps two of them, which
    is not often the case, that might be of the right disposition, close
    of tongue and bright of mind, so as to weigh all matters of whatsoever
    kind intelligently, giving a broad minded and liberal decision in any
    case. This applies the same, both to man and woman, and if all is
    satisfactory, either he or she, under the birth can be admitted to the
    Talth lodge, and sometimes they are taken through only one part and
    cannot go further, and sometimes they are taken through two parts and
    are not taken any further, and but few are taken through the whole and
    become a Talth. And no less a number than three can act in the lodge,
    and make a fourth to be a Talth. Now all these other children are of
    the high birth, and are put to act in many important places to fill at
    the festivals and in other ways. Many of them never make an application
    to become a Talth, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span> many of them are rejected, and not allowed to
    even make a start if their conduct is not proper. There never has been
    one born that is half white, or any part of any other tribe, that was
    ever admitted to the lodge. They must be full blooded Klamath, of the
    upper or lower division of the tribe, and down the coast from Ah-man
    to Trinidad. The upper rivers from the junction of the Trinity speak
    a different language, and intermarry very freely, and have the Talth
    lodge in which they work together. Up the river they have entirely
    lost it all now, and have not one lodge left. At the mouth of the
    Klamath the old lodge has tumbled down, but not one of the Talth is
    left. At Pec-wan, twenty-five miles from the mouth of the river is the
    Talth house, where all of their working tools are kept, and it is yet
    in a good state of preservation, the lodge is left but it is old the
    dilapidated.</p>

  <p>We have in our breast the feeling of love for the present white race,
    which love was instilled in us by the cherished remembrance of our
    Wa-gas. We loved this race and this is the reason our women are so
    willing to marry the white man, and so easy to be deceived by them.</p>

  <div class="subhead">LAWS OF THE FISH DAM.</div>

  <p class="drop-cap">WHEN the fish dam is put in, they have very strict laws governing it.
    There are nine traps which can be used, one belongs to Lock and his
    relatives, one to Lock-nee and his relatives, one to Normer and her
    relatives, and so on down the line. These families come in the morning
    and each one takes from the trap that which belongs to them, as many
    salmon as they need, by dipping them out with a net that is made and
    used for this purpose, and they must not let a single one go to waste,
    but must care for all they take, or suffer the penalty of the law,
    which was strictly enforced. After all these get their salmon, then
    comes the poor class, which take what they can use, some of which they
    use fresh and the rest they cut up, smoke them lightly then they are
    dried. When they are dried they are taken down and packed in large
    baskets with pepperwood leaves between each layer, so as to keep the
    moths out of them, and then they are put away for the winter. The
    Indians from up the river as far as they are able to come, can get
    salmon, and down the river the same. In these traps there get to be
    a mass of salmon, so full that they make the whole structure of the
    fish dam quiver and tremble with their weight, by holding the water
    from passing through the lattice work freely. After all have taken
    what they want of the salmon, which must be done in the early part of
    the day, Lock or Lock-nee opens the upper gates of the traps and let
    the salmon pass on up the river, and at the same time great numbers
    are passing through the open gap left on the south side of the river.
    This is done so that the Hoopas on up the Trinity river have a chance
    at the salmon catching. But they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span> keep a close watch to see that
    there are enough left to effect the spawning, by which the supply is
    kept up for the following year. The whites have often said that the
    Indians ought not to be allowed to put in the fish dam and thereby
    obstruct the run of salmon to their spawning ground, and it has been
    published in the papers that the fish dam ought to be torn out. One
    year it was published in the county papers that it had been torn out
    by the wardens, this was a false publication as it was never torn out
    by Indians or whites. On the other hand after the salmon cannery was
    established at Reck-woy, which is at the mouth of the river, the whites
    and the mixed bloods commenced to fish for the cannery; the whites have
    laws that no one is allowed to let a net extend more than two thirds
    the distance across the river, and wardens are paid to see that the
    law is obeyed, yet the whites set one net from one side two thirds
    across, and then just a few steps up another net from the other side,
    and which extends two thirds across in distance, and in a distance of
    sixty yards, there will be from eight to ten nets, making so complete
    a net-work that hardly a salmon can pass. Will the whites preserve the
    salmon through all the ages, as the Klamath Indians have done, if they
    should survive so long? Not unless they enforce the laws more strictly.</p>

  <p>While the fish dam stands against the strain of the pressure of the
    water and salmon, Lock, Kock-nee, Normer, all the girls (wah-clure)
    and the boy (char-rah) remain and watch things until the water raises
    and washes the dam out, which often takes two and three months, and
    then they all go to their homes, glad that the dam is washed away. Lock
    and Lock-nee, during all this time at the fish dam, use the utmost care
    and precaution to see that they are all kept in good health, bathing
    daily and keeping clean, so as not to soil their beautiful buck skin
    dresses that has taken the most skillful and patient work to make,
    and the most patient and skillful work to clean if soiled. All this
    whole ceremony of putting in the fish dam has been carried through
    so precisely with the teachings that have been handed down to them
    through many generations as God’s laws, that a white man, to see it
    and understand the meaning of the different parts, and then not have a
    decent respect for it and carry himself accordingly, has not been born
    of a God-loving mother. The writer has helped as a Normer in putting
    in the fish dam<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span> and knows the meaning of every move that is made.</p>

  <p>These sacred laws were given to us by the white race of people that
    inhabited this country when my people first came to this land. The
    Wa-gas in ancient times first put in the fish dam some twenty-four
    miles farther down the river, at a place called by the Indians as
    Tu-rep, which is a flat bar containing some eighty or a hundred acres,
    and is located on the south side of the river, the north side which is
    steep, being nearly a bluff, the same as it is at Cap-pell. The Wa-gas
    changed it from Tu-rep to Cap-pell, saying that Tu-rep was to close
    to the ocean. At that time the river went into the sea at Ah-man, six
    miles north of the present mouth of the river at Reck-woy. Cap-pell
    gave more of a chance for the people to get to the fish dam, and
    therefore benefit a greater number of them. They taught my people to
    put in the fish dam, and gave them all the secret and sacred teachings
    of the laws governing it. This was done before the great deluge that
    covered the world, and drowned all but the two Talth and their wives,
    who went through it all. The present site where the fish dam is built
    has been there for long ages, and the laws governing the fish dam are
    very ancient, and are now lost forever. They may put it in, but not by
    the sacred laws and regulations that was used so many generations, as
    they are lost, and no one can get them.</p>

  <div class="subhead">THE ANCIENT HOUSES.</div>

  <p class="drop-cap">MANY of the houses of the Klamath River Indians date back to the
    prehistoric centuries of the long, long ago, and have been repaired
    and rebuilt many generations. Some of them are hallowed with alluring
    traditions and inspiring history, when our people were powerful and
    ruled a mighty nation. The Indian name of these houses is Oc-lo-melth.
    One of these houses is situated at Wah-tec, less than two hundred
    yards from where the White Deer-Skin Dance is held, and is my mother’s
    house, where she was born and where she first looked out upon the light
    of a strange world. The surroundings of this house are filled with
    the romance of centuries, together with the wonderful history of the
    passing ages, as it dates back before the Indians came to this land
    from Cheek-cheek-alth. They say the house first belonged to the Wa-gas,
    the white people that were here when they first arrived. The Wa-gas
    were very fond of pets and while they lived in this house they kept a
    number of deer as pets.</p>

  <p>When the Wa-gas left this land, they left behind at this place a young
    man that was half Indian and half white. He remained for some time
    and cared for the pets, as the Wa-gas cherished them. The young man
    became lonesome for his people, in spite of the fact that he was very
    devoted to the deer, and one day he answered the call of the Wa-gas
    and followed in their footsteps, to join them in the far north. As
    he was leaving he asked the Indians of my ancient blood to care for
    his pets, as he would be absent and never return. This my people have
    done according to the request of the young man and out of their great
    friendship between the two races. This ancient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span> house became a hallowed
    spot where sacred memories fill its every surroundings of a people that
    have passed away in silence long ago.</p>

  <p>In one corner of this dwelling, within its walls, is a large stone
    trough which was made and placed there by the Wa-gas untold centuries
    ago, so they could feed their deer. The deer were fed upon the stalks
    of tobacco and the walth-pay, the stalks being pounded into fine meal,
    mixed together and then placed in the stone trough for the deer to
    eat. It was said for ages, and up to the advent of the present white
    race, that the spirits of the departed Wa-gas would come earthward in
    the deep shadows of the evening time and open a door, which was made
    in the corner of the house for that purpose, so the deer could come in
    at night and feed upon the meal. The deer would stealthily emerge from
    their forest homes at night and upon finding the door open would enter
    the house and eat the meal, then just before the break of day they
    would silently vanish into the forests, and the door would be closed
    when morning came. My mother has seen the deer coming toward the house
    in the dark shadows of evening, but she has not seen them for a good
    many years, as they have become hunted beasts of prey.</p>

  <p>Through the memory of the passing ages the Wa-gas left this land before
    the world was covered with water, and according to these traditions
    this house goes back for hundreds of centuries. This house has
    survived, with its long line of descendants, but it is now fading in
    the storm of years that are passing, and the place of its ruins will
    soon be forgotten.</p>

  <p>There are a number of these old houses in the different villages along
    the Klamath river, from its source to its mouth, and on the coast from
    Ah-man to Trinidad. At the present day most of them are deserted, and
    are left to sink into ruins and oblivion.</p>

  <p>The rattlesnake is called May-yep-pere, and they make their dwelling
    places under the ground and in the dark recesses. The children born in
    this house are not afraid of these snakes, as they never harm them.
    The snakes crawl out and over the house without restraint. I had no
    thought of fear, as the blood of ages had made me akin to these fierce
    reptiles, where my people had sheltered them and fed them for thousands
    of years.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span> In olden times the whole family would go away and leave
    the house alone for several days, sometimes for two or three weeks,
    and during their absence the snakes would creep out over the house
    and lie about in numerous places. If a stranger tried to approach the
    house they gave him warning, and if he attempted to enter they would
    at once be aroused into a fury and would attack him. My mother says
    that strangers have attempted to enter the house while the family was
    away and have been severely bitten by the rattlers. Therefore, the door
    of this house was always left unlocked, as no one would ever attempt
    to enter it that knew its strange history. If the family was at home,
    strangers could come and go at their will, as it was never known that
    the snakes ever attempted to harm any one while some member of the
    family was present.</p>

  <p>When the family would return from their sojourn, the head of the
    household, or someone who was born in this house, would precede the
    rest. I remember it was always my mother’s duty upon reaching the door
    of the house, and she would begin talking in a low tone of voice,
    saying: “We are coming home, we are here now and you must all go out of
    the way.” Upon hearing her voice the snakes would immediately begin to
    creep away to their hiding places. Upon entering she would begin to tap
    lightly upon the floor with her cane and would keep talking until all
    the snakes would disappear, after which the rest of the family would
    enter the house, talking, laughing and playing without any thought of
    the snakes ever harming them.</p>

  <p>This historical house is now owned by my mother, and in which she
    has not lived for fifteen years, but up until about five years ago
    she would go almost every day and build a fire in it and sit around
    the house and weave baskets. In the past five years it has not been
    repaired and has racked into ruins, so bad that she does not care
    to enter it any more, except on special occasions when she wants to
    break up something. For the past twenty years she has been breaking
    and pounding to pieces the stone bowls, trays and all the ancient
    implements that were left by the Wa-gas. She is endeavoring to destroy
    all these sacred reminiscences of the prehistoric days that they may
    never be ruthlessly handled and curiously gazed upon by the present
    white race. The stone trough that the deer fed out of, is so large and
    heavy that she cannot break it to pieces, but is letting it sink into
    the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span> ground, and it is being covered with rubbish, together with
    its strange charm and fascinating history, where my pen has failed to
    impress, this deep sentiment, therefore its wonderful tradition has
    faded with the closing of this chapter where a new era has dawned. My
    mother gave my husband two of the small stone bowls, as relics of the
    days that are gone forever, and he keeps them as cherished memories.</p>

  <div class="subhead">THE WARS OF KLAMATH INDIANS.</div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE Klamath Indians as a tribe, are like all other people that have
    a history dating back long before the great flood as their legends
    plainly tell. They have had wars and plenty of them, through all the
    ages, and never have laid down their bows and spears at any time to
    any other tribe or tribes, and have at different times had to fight
    every tribe, and sometimes combinations of tribes. They have many times
    been nearly exterminated at different places of habitation. It was at
    the junction of the Trinity River, that the Hoopas (Ar-me-musees)
    would come down the Trinity River and strike them in the center of the
    tribe, and kill, burn and scatter them before they could gather, and
    at times they would patch up the differences with the Hoopas, and let
    it go by without war. Thus the Hoopas became more bold and cruel, and
    began the tactics of mutilating the bodies of the slain, or cut off
    the hair of the dead and wear it when dancing their war dance. These
    things when carried to a certain point would not be tolerated, so the
    Klamaths would gather in great numbers, strong enough to throw a force
    against them that they could not resist, burn their villages and drive
    them back, taking both men and women as prisoners, until they would beg
    for peace and things would be settled, sometimes for a long period. In
    these settlements they gave women for marriage on both sides, so as to
    make relationship between them, which would keep long and everlasting
    peace periods. The Klamath Indians would take Hoopa men for slaves and
    give their own men for slaves, but at all times these were of the low
    birth and slave class that was given in this manner, and never of the
    wealthy class.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span></p>

  <p>Our tribe extended to the mouth of the Klamath and six miles north to
    Ah-man, and here they had to fight back the treacherous Crescent City
    and Smith River Indians, these He-nas were hard fighters, brutal in
    every way, killing women and children, and when they took a fancy to a
    fine looking young woman they would exterminate her people, and take
    her and try to kill her by being abusive and starving her. The Klamaths
    would fight the tribe for such deeds, and they would fight on and on
    for many years, and settle and patch up until the He-nas would do some
    unbearable act, when the Klamaths would gather a strong force and go
    after them. On several occasions they nearly exterminated the whole
    tribe of the He-nas. They were married and mixed in relationship with
    the Klamaths for over one hundred miles up the river, but the Klamath
    women dislike to marry among them on account of their cruelty. On the
    other hand the He-na women were pleased to get the opportunity to marry
    Klamath men. Our tribe extended down the coast as far as Trinidad,
    a distance of over fifty miles, and here they had to fight back the
    Mad River and Humboldt Bay Indians, which we call the Way-etts. The
    Way-etts were a large tribe, fat and lazy, living mostly on clams,
    shell fish, mussels and other fish. They were not good warriors, but
    strong in numbers, and the Klamaths easily held them to the line of
    their own territory, and with the Way-etts they would not mix in
    marriage, claiming that they were too low in morals and did not make
    and live in permanent homes, all the time moving and camping here and
    there.</p>

  <p>The Klamaths had some wars with the Redwood Creek Indians and some with
    other small tribes, and held themselves all through the ages, so as to
    have many that could call themselves pure blooded Klamath Indians.</p>

  <p>The worst of all the wars was, that the Klamath Indians were almost
    continually fighting among themselves, village against village,
    sometimes close together and sometimes far apart, one rich family and
    their slaves against another rich family and their slaves. The great
    festival, one of which was held each year unless prevented by some
    great calamity, would bring about an almost complete settlement of
    their differences, and bring them together on as near friendly terms
    as could be had, and caused the fighting to be stopped for nearly half
    the time, in many cases stopping it for all the time. In this way the
    Klamath Indians<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span> were kept from exterminating themselves, and were held
    together as a powerful tribe, there being several thousand of them
    when the first white men came. Our tribe was governed by the Talth and
    without ever having a chief.</p>

  <p>My people wore hats or caps that we made with our own hands by weaving
    them out of our basket material, with the different marks or designs
    wove into them, for many generations before the coming of the present
    white people. No woman would wear a hat that she would make herself,
    believing that it was unlucky for her to do so.</p>

  <p>It is a pleasure for me to say that my people never had a war with
    the present white people, for in the first coming of Ken-e-ahs we
    took up all differences of a serious nature between us and settled it
    ourselves, so as to make it satisfactory with them and forced it to be
    satisfactory with my people. Thus we kept down those of our people that
    were disposed to go to bloody wars, and only for this we might have
    held the whites back for a long time on account of the roughness of
    the country. It is only about seventy years since we first knew of the
    white people that are here now.</p>

  <div class="subhead">THE MARRIAGE LAWS.</div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE Klamath Indians intermarry to some extent with the surrounding
    tribes. The upper and lower divisions of the Klamath tribes marry very
    freely, being the same tribe, with the exception that their language
    is different. The two divisions are so closely associated with each
    other that many of our people speak both languages fluently. It was
    always considered a good marriage for a man of the lower division to
    marry a woman of the upper division, or a man of the upper division to
    marry a woman of the lower division, but they always preferred to marry
    outside their own division if possible, as they were not so liable to
    marry relations. It was not considered good to marry relations, even to
    fifth and sixth cousins, as their law taught them that marrying blood
    relations was a crime against posterity. It was considered a crime
    for parents to bring demented or deformed children into the world.
    By marriage they keep a close trace of their relationship, the woman
    never loses her identity by marrying, as she takes the name of her
    husband and the husband takes the name of his wife, as the following
    will illustrate: a Trinidad woman marries a man of the Pec-wan village,
    the Indian name of which is Cho-ri, therefore the woman is Cho-ri
    woman, and they call her husband after marriage Cho-rosh; the husband
    is a Pec-wan man, therefore they call the wife after him and call her
    Pec-wish-on. The children are called Pec-wan-alth, and are always
    addressed by these names which remind them that their mother is a
    Cho-ri woman, and their father a Pec-wan. This custom is followed so
    that they can trace out their relationship exactly for generations.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span></p>

  <p>Occasionally a Talth will marry the daughter of a wealthy family,
    however, they are very careful in selecting their wives, as they
    usually marry into the Talth families, if they can marry where there
    is no relationship. Some of the very rich men had plural wives, or as
    many wives as they cared to support, but the average Indian had but one
    wife. There has been some instances of plural marriages since the white
    man made his appearance on the Klamath River, one of which I will make
    special mention of. This Indian who had made eleven women his wives,
    was born under the very lowest marriage laws, at the Wah-teck village
    and was known as Ca-wah-ter; his parents were extremely poor, living
    in poverty and squalor at the Wah-tec village, where they raised a
    large family of children. The romance of his parents was very pathetic
    as they had nothing to give in exchange of the marriage vows, except
    some manzanita berries. The exchange of food-stuffs in the marriage
    ceremony is considered the very lowest of marriages that could be
    called a marriage. From this lowly marriage were born several brothers
    and one sister, Ga-wah-ter and his brothers, when they had grown into
    manhood, were all industrious and became good managers in securing
    wealth, as the bitter taunts of the poverty of their parents urged
    them on to greater ambitions. While they were children, the children
    of the middle and wealthy class would not associate with or play with
    them, always being coldly shunned by the other children and looked down
    upon as unworthy of respect. Children of the wealthier class would
    always make insinuations that the brothers and sister of this family
    were born under the very lowest of marriage, that their parents were
    nothing, hardly worthy of notice. These children grew up almost in
    desperation, being despised so much for their poverty, and the storms
    of insinuations were continually hurled at them in defiance, to become
    anything better, where their birth was so lowly. When they reached
    manhood, they were stricken with remorse because of their lowly birth
    right, their parents were both born of good birth, their families
    having at one time a good deal of wealth before they were married so
    unfortunately. With that remorse of poverty sunken deep into their
    hearts these young men started out in the pursuit of the Indian life to
    hunt, trap, fish and accumulate all the wealth they could possibly get.
    Early and late the brothers were always at work, as great ambitions
    spurred them on to accumulate vast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span> riches, and rise up from the lowly
    depths, where they had been so despised. They worked and banked their
    wealth together until they became very rich, then they separated
    and married, each taking his portion of the wealth as they went to
    different places to make homes for their families.</p>

  <p>Ga-wah-ter, with renewed energies every time he thought of the bitter
    stings of his early boyhood years and struggles, determined to become
    one of the richest men on the lower Klamath River. His prayers were
    so sincere, his ambitions so great, his toil so earnest, that his
    reward came after the weary years of struggle, for he was now one
    of the richest men the Klamath River had known for generations. He
    rose to power and greatness from a miserable down-trodden child. Now
    his triumphs were supreme, for he had crowned himself with success
    and everlasting power, and could now look down upon those who had
    scorned him so much in his youth, for they could never be so rich as
    he. When his vast fortune was made, eleven wives shared his home at
    Ser-e-goin village, where he spent most of his wedded life. His first
    wife belonged to the upper division of the Klamath Indians, and was
    the romantic bride of his life, as he had given to her the love of his
    young manhood, and his tender devotion was hers throughout the years
    of their wedded life. When the ten other brides had come to dwell in
    their home, she remained his constant companion and counselor of the
    household. One to five children were born to all the wives except the
    first wife. Sometimes the wives would all get to quarreling and become
    very insolent to one another, when the husband would appear upon the
    scene and whip them all, except his first wife, he never punished her
    as he loved her more than all the rest.</p>

  <p>For many years, with riches, wives and children around him, he was a
    powerful member of the Klamath Indians. As he grew old, family troubles
    arose among his relatives and sons, which resulted in bloodshed and
    loss of lives. One day, under the excitement of all these troubles, he
    started to swim across the river as no canoe was at hand, and while
    swimming across at Ser-e-goin village severe cramps overtook his
    already tired body, and he met the tragic death of drowning. A very
    large family of children were left fatherless, and the wives separated
    off from the home at Ser-e-goin, each one taking her own children.
    Some of these children are alive yet and have a great deal of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span> wealth.
    This closes the summary of one of the plural marriages of the Klamath
    Indians.</p>

  <p>Some of the Talth had plural wives, but they always married the first
    wife by the highest marriage ceremony, so that the children born under
    this marriage would be eligible to be admitted to the sacred lodge.
    As before, the husband takes the wife’s name and is always addressed
    by her name, while the wife is addressed by the husband’s name, an
    exchange of names as well as the exchange of marriage vows. The other
    women that may be married to a Talth, under the plural marriage, are
    not married by the highest marriage laws, therefore, their children
    can never be admitted to the sacred lodge. Plural marriages among the
    Talth are very seldom, and a Talth under no circumstances will marry a
    slave, or any one of the low class. The Talth usually select their wife
    or husband with great care from the families of high birth. When they
    marry they live very happily, and are devoted to their families. They
    were never known to gamble or drink the white man’s whiskey, their soul
    being free from all temptations. I will here illustrate the devotion of
    one of the Talth marriages. This Talth was of a very wealthy family of
    the Pec-wan village, who married a woman of the Tu-rep village. Under
    the Indian laws of marriage, the husband took his wife’s name and was
    known as Tur-rep-ah-wah and the wife was known as Pec-wish-on. After
    they had been married for two or three years the wife contracted a
    chronic illness, which made her almost a helpless invalid for a number
    of years, and the devoted husband would cook, wash, sweep and attend to
    all the household duties. He remained by the side of his sick wife day
    and night, administering to her every want, lead her tenderly about,
    take her in his canoe for long boat rides on the river, that she might
    get the fresh air and grow strong again. He secured the very best
    Indian Doctors for her, and payed all the doctor bills during all the
    years of her illness. His kind patience and attentions towards her,
    never failed him, as he continued in this way, giving up all his time
    to his wife for a number of years, until at last, with all his effort,
    he succeeded in almost making her well, and she is yet alive. He lived
    for a few years, then died leaving her a widow.</p>

  <p>The Talth marriage is a long ceremony, where a great deal of wealth
    is exchanged between the two families of the bride and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span> groom. This
    ceremony is principally performed by the Indian money, cheek, which is
    a long slender shell, conical in shape and is inclined to be curved.
    It is about one and a half to two and a quarter inches in length,
    and is valued according to its length, and longer the shell the more
    value it is. This money is measured by the rings of the joints of the
    middle finger from the inside of the left hand, and it takes twelve
    pieces of cheek to make one string, which is called cor-ton-a. In
    stringing the cheek they put the two large ends together and the two
    small ends together, this is done to prevent the shells from cupping
    inside. In estimating the value of a string of cheek, we hold one end
    of the string between the fore-finger and thumb-nail of the left hand,
    drawing it tightly up the arm towards the shoulder, keeping the arm
    extended straight. Ten of the cheek on the string are measured in this
    way, not measuring the two which makes twelve on the string, as the
    twelve only make ten, according to our numeration; we do not count the
    extra two cheek on the string as we wish to give full value, so that
    no one will be able to find any fault as to the value of the string.
    In measuring the cheek a tattoo is made on the arm where the end of
    the string comes, so they can easily detect if any of the cheek has
    been exchanged, should it happen to be handled by different persons.
    In marriage the young Talth gives twelve strings of this cheek to the
    parents of his bride, as it is the real Indian money that we brought
    from the old land of Cheek-cheek-alth, the parents give in exchange
    other valuable articles to their son-in-law. The elder Talth always
    attend these high marriages, bringing with them the herb, walth-pay,
    with which they give the benediction to the bridal couple, in wishing
    them peace, love, happiness and success.</p>

  <p>The children born under these marriages are selected by the Talth and
    are given the opportunity to become a Talth. A Talth is very reserved
    and never advances to meet anyone who is a stranger that is inquiring
    into our traditions. Our traditions and religion are too sacred to
    be expounded before strangers of another race, therefore the white
    man has received most of his allegory from the lower classes of the
    Indians. This type of Indian readily gives the fairy tales of the
    tribe, such as mothers and grandmothers tell to the little children for
    their amusement, and these are the stories that the white man is made
    to believe as the true traditions and religion of the Indian. These
    stories<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span> are no more like the traditions and religion of the Indian
    than daylight is like night.</p>

  <p>There is another marriage law that is termed among the Indians as,
    “half married.” The prospective husband gives but a small sum of
    articles, of little value, and receives in return a few articles of
    little value. In this marriage the husband is taken to the wife’s home
    to live, or in the same house with her parents, and the wife, in this
    marriage, is the head of the household and the husband is compelled
    to obey her in whatever she commands him to do. He is compelled to
    fish, hunt, work and support her folks just as much as he supports his
    wife, while the wife teaches the children and rules them absolutely,
    as the husband has no right to correct his own children or make them
    mind in any way. When these children become men and women they must
    marry according to their mother’s wishes, as the husband has nothing
    to say as to their conduct, or pursuits of happiness in life. However
    unpleasant it may seem to him, he must bear it all with patience and
    silence. If he refuses to obey his wife and children, she can make his
    surroundings in home life very unpleasant for him, and if he wishes to
    dissolve the marriage vows and she is willing, he has nothing to do but
    to walk out of the house, as his wife guides the children and rules
    the household, and owns everything that belongs to him, except his own
    individual life, even his own children acknowledge him as their father
    in flesh and blood, but no more.</p>

  <p>There is a slave marriage where, they being absolute paupers, having
    no home of their own and no articles to exchange in the marriage
    ceremony, they are married by the exchange of food-stuffs, and this is
    considered to be the lowest marriage that could be called a marriage.
    When they have a divorce they do not have much trouble in separating as
    articles are given back by their masters and a settlement is usually
    made easy.</p>

  <p>In some of the Indian marriages, they do not mate happily. After they
    have been married a short time, or even a number of years, serious
    trouble arises and results in a final separation, and when such a
    separation is agreed upon, and there are no children, all the valuables
    exchanged at the marriage alter are returned accordingly. If there
    are children and the father wants them to remain legitimate he must
    be very careful in counting out the valuables or the wealth that he
    wants returned from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span> his wife’s people. He must divide a portion of the
    wealth that he gave to his wife’s people on his wedding day, to each
    child, the remaining portion is given back to him. If all the valuables
    of exchange between the contracting parties are returned to him or his
    people, this leaves the children as bastards, without a law to protect
    them from slanderous tongues and no rights to a legitimate birth.
    These children are forever looked down upon by the Indian society,
    as bastards without a marriage to legalize them as the off-spring of
    respectable parents. I can truthfully say that in the past twenty-five
    years, and more, since the advent of the white man among the Klamath
    Indians, that most of the white men have married under the half married
    system, until there are no Indian marriage laws. The “squaw” gives her
    “white buck” her home and supports his low born half breed children,
    while he idles his time away on the Indian ranches or lies about in
    a drunken stupor. Yet these same white men cry, is there no redress
    for the Indian, has he no soul to save? Oh, not a soul to save under
    these conditions. But why do these white men hang around the Indian
    ranches and reservations, living off the toils of the Indian? There
    is a pathetic story in this nefarious business of human lives. The
    Indian himself has followed pursuit after his white brethren in the
    half married system, or not marrying at all, until there is no sacred
    marriage tie. This shows positively, that the Indian laws are forever
    lost. Education is the only way out of these difficulties, for those
    who have had an opportunity to attend the schools have married under
    the laws of the United States, and these laws must be enforced, since
    all the Indian laws have been abolished by the degenerate white men. I
    trust the day is not far distant when the degenerate white man will no
    longer be tolerated to camp on the reservations and leave in his path
    the ruination of human lives.</p>

  <p>Before the appearance of the white man, the marriage of the middle and
    wealthy classes were considered sacred, the most sacred ties that could
    bind a human being for the cause of the future generation. Divorces
    were considered a disgrace upon posterity and a shame upon moral
    society, therefore, divorces were few and far between. When a divorce
    cause was pleaded, usually trouble ensued that resulted in bloodshed
    before the case would be settled. These divorces sometimes left the
    birth of the children<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span> for slanderous tongues to assail, and when these
    children became of age they would resent bitterly the action of their
    father and mother, and the feud would be renewed, sometimes for several
    generations before a final settlement would be made. Divorces among the
    Indians were very difficult to obtain, as it was ruinous to posterity,
    and a menace upon society. Among the Talth divorces were unknown.</p>

  <div class="subhead">THE TWO FAMOUS ATHLETES.</div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE Indians play a game that is similar to the white man’s football
    game, with the exception that the Indians use sticks and the white man
    a ball, therefore this game has been termed in English as the “stick
    game”, the Indian name for it is oh-wetlth-per. They select the giants,
    or the greatest athletes of the tribe to make up the two teams. In
    this contest one division of the tribe will offer a challenge to the
    surrounding tribes, and the challenge is contested by any division, who
    think they are capable and strong enough to make the meet. The Klamath
    tribe usually played games with the upper division of the tribe and
    often plays against the Hoopa Indians, and sometimes the Smith Rivers.
    Each side would put up large sums of money and valuable articles for
    their chosen team, which would cause much excitement in betting and
    gambling upon the games. The side of the victorious team would win
    large sums of Indian money, which would add to the wealth of their
    division and make them more powerful. Therefore, each division would be
    very careful in selecting their giant athletes. The tallest, quickest,
    strongest and the most splendid physiques of men were chosen.</p>

  <p>The Indians selected a level piece of ground, upon which to play the
    game. There is one of these famous play grounds but a few yards from
    the Wah-tec village. This game is very ancient as the Indians say that
    it goes far back into the ages, and through the memory of evolution
    they have carried it forward down to the present day, where it will
    soon be lost forever unless the advent of the new race revives the old
    spirit of the game again. Upon the play ground they draw a very large
    circle with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span> lines across it, then stepping to the center of this
    circle they make a small round hole which is about ten inches across at
    the surface, and from this hole they draw several other lines out to
    the large circle, thus mapping out the different points of the game,
    as on a tennis court. They take two little sticks, about three inches
    in length and carve out a nob at each end, then they fasten these two
    sticks together with a strong buck skin string and spread the untied
    ends apart about two inches, then they place the two tied sticks in the
    holes in the center of the court. Each team consists of twelve men,
    and they have an umpire to give the signal to start the game, and to
    see that no foul or unfair means are taken by either side of the team.
    The men in each team have round sticks about twenty inches in length
    and are straight with the exception that a hook is made or carved on
    one end, which is used for the purpose of hooking the tied sticks and
    tossing them about. There are twelve points to be played in this game.</p>

  <p>When the two teams are lined up on the court, the umpire gives the
    signal for them to start, and the game is on. The leaders of the teams
    are watched from both sides, and scramble to see which side hooks the
    tied stick first from the middle of the court with his stick, and toss
    it as far as he can over his opponent’s side of the court. Both teams
    now make a wild scramble, and pile up on one another in their effort
    to hook the sticks again with their sticks, and toss them back into
    their opponent’s territory. If one of the teams can manage to toss the
    tied sticks out over the large circle of the court, on their opponent’s
    side, they are the ones who win the point in the game. The team that
    can win the largest score in the number of points played in the game,
    are the winners. The champion team is applauded and praised loudly by
    the immense crowds that gather to witness these interesting games. The
    players in their wild enthusiasm for the glorious laurels of victory
    usually clash together so roughly in their efforts to rescue the
    sticks from the other players, that occasionally some of their number
    get hurt, and often crippled for life. There are some instances where
    a player has been killed outright upon the court, in his desperate
    struggles against the on-rushing crowd.</p>

  <p>In olden time when this game was played so much, there lived a young
    Indian by the name of Su-me-ah-chene, who became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span> one of the greatest
    athletes that the tribe ever had. He became so skilled in the game that
    he would never lose a single point. His dwelling place was on top of a
    high mountain that rose up in it majestic grandeur from the north-east
    banks of the Klamath River, and this place was over a distance of
    five miles from the village of Ca-neck, and this mountain was named
    in honor of the great champion and still bears his name to this day,
    being known among the Indians as the mountain of Su-me. Su-me-ah-chene
    became very proud of his accomplishments in this favorite game, and
    issued a challenge to all the young men of the surrounding tribes,
    as he was anxious to match himself against any of their champions.
    His challenge was finally taken up by a young man who lived back of
    Trinidad and whose dwelling place was also located on a high mountain,
    east of Trinidad, toward Redwood Creek. The grandeur of this mountain
    can be seen many miles away, up and down the coast and from many places
    far back on the surrounding mountains. This mountain is covered with a
    huge growth of pine and redwood timber, and is known among the Indians
    as Cay-way-ett mountain, being named after the famous athlete who lived
    upon its summit. Su-me-ah-chene, hearing of Cay-way-ett’s intentions
    of taking up the challenge, sent him word that he was ready to play.
    Cay-way-ett at once accepted the challenge, and they made arrangements
    to play the game on the Klamath River, at the village of Ca-neck.
    The court was selected at the lower end of the high river bar, which
    made an ideal place to play the game. The two youthful giants both
    belonged to the lower divisions of the Klamath tribe. Together they
    made arrangements for the day when the big meet should be held. They
    had now won the distinction of being the two leading athletes of the
    tribes, and they sent their invitations far and near, to all the people
    of the tribes to come and witness the great feat for the championship.
    Inspired with a great enthusiasm the people assembled around the play
    ground, in a vast multitude, that was eager, restless and talking, as
    the two giants appeared upon the court with their teams. Striding upon
    the court with the spring and step of the greatest of athletes, they
    represented two handsome figures as were ever seen among the tribes.
    They proudly met as superb beings in stately birth and tawny muscles,
    and many a maiden’s heart was thrilled with emotion, when they beheld
    these champions, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span> handsomest of men. The two champions had as yet
    been proof against the arrows of matrimony, and all the pretty and
    wealthy maidens of the tribes had assembled to behold the everlasting
    courage and endurance of these two strong youths.</p>

  <p>As the umpire gave the signal for the game to start, the crowds watched
    with keen interest. Su-me-ah-chene and his team played hard and furious
    as their opponents were close upon them and after a long and desperate
    struggle he and his team succeeded in tossing the tied sticks over the
    outer circle of the court, and won the first point amid the applauding
    and shouting of the spectators. An intermission for rest is always held
    after each point, and Su-me-ah-chene glowing in the first triumphs left
    the court, and walked among the maidens to make their acquaintance and
    hear their words of praise. As he spoke to many he lingered in a crowd
    of up river girls, where his attention was attracted to three dark eyed
    beauties, who had come from Cah-ah-man or known to the white people as
    Orleans Bar, he at once made their acquaintance and lingered, talking
    with them until it was time for him to join his team and play for the
    second point. Renewed with strange emotions, something akin to love,
    the gallant champion played furious and won point after point, until
    the game was finished. He had not lost a single point in the game.
    During the intermission of each point, he would seek out the three
    pretty maidens, and linger in their company until he fancied himself
    desperately in love with one of them. Laureled with fame and wealth,
    at the close of the game he proceeded at once to the girls, and walked
    with them as they mingled with the departing crowds. Walking at the
    side of the maiden he was loath to part with her at all, as he extended
    to the three girls a hearty invitation for them to come and visit his
    home, in the village of Su-me. They eagerly accepted his invitation
    as they were highly honored to get the opportunity to visit him, and
    they inquired of him how they would find his house from the rest of
    the houses in the village. He assured them that they would make no
    mistake in finding the house, as he described to them that there was
    a large pine tree standing just in front of his home. There were no
    green branches on this tree as it had died a long time ago, and the
    small sap-suckers had bored into the trunk of the tree and built their
    homes there as they could be seen flying about the tree. He gave them
    such a vivid description<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span> of the tree, that he assured them they could
    not possibly miss his house. The girls were delighted with him and
    departed with bright anticipations in visiting the champion in his
    home. Say-gap, or the Coyote who lived in his home at the lower western
    end of the Su-me village, was near the happy group and over heard
    Su-me-ah-chene’s invitation and description of the dead pine tree, so
    he planned to entertain the girls himself, that they may not go to
    visit Su-me-ah-chene in his home.</p>

  <p>The day that the girls had planned to visit Su-me-ah-chene, Mr.
    Coyote moved the pine tree down in front of his house, and when the
    girls arrived at the village of Su-me, they began at once to look
    for the tree Su-me-ah-chene had described to them. After they had
    looked about for a short time, one of them pointed down the hill to
    the lower western end of the village, to the tree, and said that must
    be the place they were looking for, delighted upon seeing the tree,
    they rushed down the hill to Say-gap’s house. Say-gap met them at
    the door with a cordial welcome, and asked them in, they all entered
    the house and seated themselves while he was planning how he could
    best entertain the girls and make himself appear very attractive to
    them. He summoned his grandmother and asked her to spread a banquet
    for the young ladies, and told her she must prepare the very best of
    food-stuffs they had in the house for the evening meal. The grandmother
    began to move about in the adjoining room in the rear of the house,
    as if she was preparing the food for supper. She had a large basket
    of acorn mush already cooked and hid away, so her nephew (he was her
    nephew instead of her grandchild) would not eat it all himself, as he
    would always eat up everything that was good and let her go hungry.
    This acorn mush she kept hid and did not bring it out for Say-gap and
    his guests to feast upon. She pretended to look among the shelves for
    awhile and fumbled through them, when she at last brought out a large
    Indian plate of shrimps, or some sort of worm, that looked very much
    like shrimps. She came into the room where Say-gap was entertaining the
    girls and began to roast the worms on the coals. The worms would twist
    about on the coals, pop and fly all over the house. The girls looked
    at one another in dismay, and wondered if this was the best food that
    his house could afford, they became very angry and said that they had
    been deceived. Rising from the seats they told their host that they now
    did not believe him to be Su-me-ah-chene,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span> but he was an imposter. They
    fled from the house in a rage and returned to their homes at Orleans
    Bar. Say-gap followed them home and kept pleading, saying he was
    Su-me-ah-chene, their much admired champion of the “stick game.” This
    made the girls more peeved than ever, so they made a resolution among
    themselves, that they would not accept Su-me-ah-chene’s attentions or
    consider any excuses that he might offer, if they chanced to meet him
    again.</p>

  <p>After a few days the girls received word that Su-me-ah-chene was going
    to play again at another big meet, so they all agreed to go and see
    it as before. At the meet Su-me-ah-chene in his usual good spirits
    was animated with glory upon winning the first point, so during the
    intermission he resolved to find the three girls and inquire why
    they did not keep their promise to visit him, as he felt very much
    disappointed. Upon finding the girls he greeted them in his usual good
    humor, but they drew themselves up haughtily and refused to speak to
    him, as they believed that he was making light of them and having a
    lot of amusement among his friends at their expense. As before he won
    all the points, and during the intermissions he would return to the
    girls, thinking perhaps he could find out what was wrong and win their
    friendship again. The girls as before treated him very coldly, and were
    so haughty that they would not listen to any of his excuses. Toward
    the closing of the game the three girls moved over on Cry-way-ett’s
    side of the court, which provoked Su-me-ah-chene. When the crowds
    started for their homes after the game, Su-me-ah-chene said he would
    go down to the mouth of the river, at Reck-woy village to visit for a
    few days, as he had been turned down by the three girls. Upon reaching
    the village, a host of pretty girls were glad to meet the much talked
    of champion, and all greeted him with a royal welcome. When his visit
    ended, he announced to the girls his intentions of playing another game
    at Ca-neck with the Cay-way-ett team, and gave them all an invitation
    to come.</p>

  <p>Again another game was being held at Ca-neck, for the championship
    between Su-me-ah-chene and Cay-way-ett. All the Reck-woy girls were
    to be present, and were highly honored to think that Su-me-ah-chene
    himself had invited them. Su-me-ah-chene and his team as usual won the
    first point and during the intermission for rest he went among the
    Reck-woy girls to visit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span> with them. They were all pleased to be honored
    with his company and marveled over his great athletic feats, and he
    soon fancied that he was falling in love again. This time with one of
    the pretty little Reck-woy girls.</p>

  <p>Su-me-ah-chene won every point as he had in the previous games, and
    after receiving the cheering congratulations of the Reck-woy girls,
    together with the maiden of his choice, he invited some of them to come
    and visit him at his home. The girls were pleased over the invitation
    to visit him, and promised to visit him in a few days. He described to
    them the dead pine tree, where the sap-sucker would be flying about, so
    they could easily find the house, which was located near the center of
    the village. Four of the girls came to visit the champion as they had
    promised, they crossed the river and climbed the hill to Su-me village,
    where following his directions closely they easily found the tree and
    the house. They found him home, and entered, he appearing handsomer
    than ever, as he greeted them with a hearty welcome, and said he was
    glad they had kept their promise. He entertained them so nicely that
    the time went by quickly, and he was loath to have them depart so soon.
    They were having such a splendid time that he suggested they spend the
    night at his home, to which the girls readily agreed. The next morning
    the girls returned to their homes at Reck-woy, very tired and happy
    after being so pleasantly entertained by the young champion. A few
    days after the departure of the girls Su-me-ah-chene decided he would
    go to Reck-woy and return the visit, and during this visit a romance
    developed into matrimony, as he wooed for his bride the pretty maiden
    of his choice. After the wedding the proud little bride accompanied
    her husband to his home, where she began housekeeping in an elegant
    fashion. Meanwhile his rival Cay-way-ett and the maid of Orleans Bar
    had married.</p>

  <p>After the wedding of the giants, they were very happy with their brides
    only for a short time, and they challenged each other for another game,
    to which they both agreed. The multitudes of people had assembled to
    witness the big meet as usual, to applaud and praise their favorite
    champion. While the two giants were engaged upon the court with their
    powerful teams, the wife of Cay-way-ett stole away from the crowd
    to the home of Su-me-ah-chene, upon reaching it she entered, and
    selected one of the beautiful dresses of Mrs. Su-me-ah-chene and gowned
    herself in it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span> She dolled herself up very handsomely in the dress and
    ornaments and seated herself in the seat of honor, as being the lady
    of the household. Su-me-ah-chene approached Mrs. Cay-way-ett believing
    her to be his wife, as she assured him that she was his Reck-woy wife
    instead of the bride from Orleans. Mrs. Su-me-ah-chene saw her husband,
    to her great indignation, caress the other woman and at once believed
    him to be unfaithful to her. She at once recognized the beautiful
    dress that Mrs. Cay-way-ett wore to be her own, and all this leading
    her to believe stronger than ever that this strange woman had stolen
    the affection of her husband, and that he had allowed her to usurp her
    of her household. Believing this all to be true, Mrs. Su-me-ah-chene
    assailed her husband to his great surprise, with a hot torrent of angry
    words, and fled from him, back to her home in Reck-woy. The truth
    dawned upon the broken hearted champion that Mrs. Cay-way-ett had
    deceived him in making him believe that she was his wife, and at once
    sought his girl bride at Reck-woy, and pleaded at her feet to return
    with him to their home at Su-me. But her pride had been wounded beyond
    endurance, and she haughtily turned from the greatest of champions, and
    the greatest of men, and left his stately form bowed down with grief,
    a sense of a deep loss, and the sorrowing presence of loneliness.
    Thus the true sweet bride of his affections had been ruthlessly borne
    by the wings of fate, away from the love of his mighty manhood.
    Grieved and hurt by this great blow, he refused the attentions of Mrs.
    Cay-way-ett. This treacherous woman had sought revenge, as she believed
    that Su-me-ah-chene had deceived her for his own amusement, when she
    first visited him at Su-me, and the Say-gap had followed her to her
    home at Orleans Bar. As the wife of the other giant, Cay-way-ett, she
    became enamored with the mightiest of athletes, Su-me-ah-chene, as she
    remembered he was once her lover. Having lost his love after he became
    the champion, she was thrilled with passions for his great victories,
    and determined to deceive him. She falsely declared to her husband
    that she was going on a visit to her people at Orleans Bar, and he
    readily consented to her going. For a time he believed that his wife
    was visiting her people, but to his great disappointment he found her
    to be unfaithful to the marriage vows, as she was attempting to win the
    love and admiration of Su-me-ah-chene. Thus the greatest of men were
    robbed of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span> affections of their young brides, the cheer and comfort
    in their homes of fame and wealth, and the love of a glorious womanhood
    had faded. The moral of this story is to impress the fact upon the mind
    of a young bride that if she is fickle with the love of a great man,
    and plans to deceive him, in the belief that she will win a greater
    man, and a greater love, she will most likely to her great sorrow lose
    them both. Far better to love the truly great, who love you in return,
    than to lose that love in plotting and planning, for the greatest who
    love you not.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="subhead">PEC-WAN COLONEL.</div>

  <p class="drop-cap">PEC-WAN Colonel (his Indian name was Me-quin) had been for the last
    fifty or sixty years, the richest Indian among the lower Klamaths.
    When standing erect he was probably a little over six feet, of medium
    build and was very graceful in his movement. He was a fine looking
    man, and every inch an aristocrat. He was a descendant of a very
    wealthy family on both sides of the house, and his mother was born
    in the Cor-tep village, about one half-mile below Pec-wan village.
    There was five boys and two girls of his mother’s family, his Uncles,
    Aunts, and Grandmother on his father’s side, belonged to the upper
    division of the tribe, and they too were a wealthy family. Pec-wan’s
    mother was from a family of doctors, his mother and her two sisters
    being doctors, his mother was without question the most noted and
    prominent woman doctor that the lower rivers had among them, for the
    past seventy-five years or more. When she married his father, whom
    they called Cor-tep-pish, by his being married to a Cor-tep woman, she
    married a man of a very wealthy family, and when her mother and father
    died they cut her off, and did not give her any part of the riches of
    her own family, but divided it among the four sisters and two brothers.</p>

  <p>She had five children, three girls and two boys, the Colonel being the
    third child, and he followed close in his mother’s ways. She would go
    out and sit on her door-steps of the front porch, stoop over with her
    elbows on her knees, and comb her hair over her face with her fingers,
    then rest her chin on her hands, and sit gazing into the distance, and
    other ways, thereby causing all to be afraid of her except the Talth
    and their families, over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span> whom she had no control. All the wealthy and
    slave classes became sorely afraid of her. Whenever the people would
    see her sitting thus, they began to murmur among themselves, saying
    that she was trying to make some one sick, and that some body would
    be sick. If some one should become sick anywhere within a distance of
    a number of miles from her, their first thought was that she had made
    them sick, and she was the one that could cure them. These doctors
    are paid in advance for their services, and when they came after her,
    instead of accepting what pay they brought and offered to her, she
    would talk with the greatest of shrewdness, comment on the case and
    demand of them the most valuable articles which she knew they had, and
    would scheme to get all she could. She seemed to have a magic power
    to cure, and did cure in most cases as she had perfect confidence in
    herself, and gave perfect confidence to the sick one of her ability
    to make them well; somewhat on the same principal of the Christian
    Scientist among the people of today. But for this pay the doctor has
    to cure the sick person, and if the patient should die within a year
    from the time the doctor prescribed for them, she is compelled to
    give back all that was given to her. This doctor seldom had to return
    her fee and gathered wealth in abundance, and succeeded in her shrewd
    practice. Taking from her brothers and sisters the entire fortune
    that her mother and father had left them, she had power and influence
    among her people. She tried to make doctors of her three daughters,
    but they became the most commonest kind. She turned nearly all of her
    fortune wealth over to her son, the Colonel, and while he did not have
    the shrewdness of his mother, he managed in the long run by deaths
    and otherwise, to get possession of the greater part of the wealth of
    so many rich relations, that he too had power and influence above his
    people. His walk, manner and very actions, were very impressive to any
    one that met him. He would never eat in a white man’s house, my house
    was the only white man’s house he was ever known to stop in over night,
    and eat at the table. He was very liberal in his own house, and the
    white man has had many meals at his table. Pec-wan Colonel was born at
    Pec-wan village, where the Talth lodge is located.</p>

  <p>A full blooded Klamath Indian, born of wealthy parents but of the
    middle class, and with all of his wealth and influence could not become
    a Talth, therefore he could at all times and on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span> all occasions keep
    his place; he knew where he could come in, and where to keep back with
    perfect ease. He was closely related to the Talth families, and when it
    came to festivals, he could and did lead them all with more deer skins,
    silver grey fox skins and other kinds, with enough strings of turk-tum
    and cheek to cover the breast of all who danced, besides long and
    valuable flints, both red and black and all kind of dancing fixtures.
    He always kept a large camp with plenty of provisions, and plenty of
    women to cook and wait on the crowds, he was very liberal and fed many.</p>

  <p>He was mean to his slaves and cared nothing for visiting Indians of
    other tribes, only his own Klamath people, and to all of these he was
    closely related to, far up the river, and he visited them as far up as
    they lived. In the large festivals he could draw on the Pech-ic-las,
    his relatives, for whatever he wanted to keep him at all times in the
    lead. He had but one wife, she was also of a wealthy family, and when
    he thought at one time to take another wife she told him plainly, that
    there would be no two wives for her, that she could and would go to her
    father’s home and not return, so he gave up the notion and remained
    with her.</p>

  <p>She was a good woman, very kind of disposition and pleasant of manner;
    she never had any children, and has been dead now for about twelve
    years. There is a nephew of his named Pec-wan Harry, he married a woman
    who lived close to the mouth of the river at Wah-kell village and he is
    now called Wah-kell Harry, and they have quite a family of children,
    and to him went nearly all of the wealth. He too is a fine looking man
    of the same build as Pec-wan Colonel.</p>

  <div class="subhead">A NARRATIVE OF THE HUMBOLDT INDIANS.</div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE following is a true narrative of the way that the Humboldt Indians
    (Way-yets) have been treated and almost exterminated by the white man.
    Humboldt Bay being a harbor where vessels could come in and make a safe
    landing, was the place where the whites would naturally first make a
    settlement, and make a base from which to supply the miners and cattle
    raisers, therefore it soon became a town. First it was called Bucksport
    and afterwards named Eureka, and the whole surrounding country was at
    the first coming of the white man thickly populated with Indians, there
    being hundreds of them, and even up into the thousands. These Indians,
    the Klamath River Indians, called in their language the Way-yets,
    and the country in which they lived or around Humboldt Bay, they
    called We-ott. They also had names for the different places, such as
    Ar-ca-tah, (Arcata) Per-wer (Eureka), and at times they would call the
    whole of the country Per-wer.</p>

  <p>As the whites became more numerous they began to crowd the Indians back
    more and more, never at anytime willing to concede that the Indians
    had any right to any thing that they wanted, until the Indians began
    to rebel at being drove from their homes, where they had lived for
    thousands of years. Whenever they made the least resistance, the whites
    were up in arms, until finally the Humboldt Indians were moved to a
    reservation at Smith River and kept there for a time, among the Smith
    River Indians. The Smith River Indians were not friendly with them, not
    treating them kindly and many of them died there for the want of food
    as they did not know the country and could not gather food supplies.
    When some of them would go out to get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span> fish or gather supplies the
    Smith River Indians, being jealous of them, would follow and kill them,
    and the soldiers would never say a word or reprimand them and only
    laugh at them. They had no medicine case when sick and had no way of
    treating the sick ones in their way. They had no sanitary provisions
    and could not keep themselves clean, which they were strict in their
    own homes. The young girls had no rights with the soldiers or white men
    and were diseased, and if an Indian made any objection to the white
    man’s treatment, they were in return kicked and abused, and often
    killed, in this way many of them died at Smith River.</p>

  <p>The Klamath Indians called Crescent City, Caw-pay, and Smith River,
    He-na, and all the Indians are one tribe and they call them He-nas,
    but sometimes designate the certain part in which they live, by
    calling them Caw-pay Indians, So after they had been kept on Smith
    River reservation for awhile, they were driven like a lot of hogs,
    only with less care as to whether they lived or died, to the Klamath
    River Reservation, which extended from the Pacific up the Klamath River
    for a distance of twenty miles, extending out one mile on either side
    of the river. When they were driven to the Klamath River Reservation
    they were treated by the lower Klamath Indians in a more humane way,
    as a part of the Klamath Indians were good to them and tried to see
    them get something to live on, and would doctor the sick ones, helping
    them as much as they could, that is, a certain part of them would.
    They kept the ones that were disposed to be unfriendly to the poor
    Humboldts from doing them harm, yet many of them died while on the
    Klamath. After keeping them for a while the order came to move them to
    the Hoopa Indian Reservation, which is situated on the Trinity River,
    and comes down the Trinity to its junction with the Klamath River, and
    into Humboldt County; so the Humboldts were gathered together again
    by the soldiers, and were kicked and clubbed, the children thrown
    into boats, and when killed they were cast into the river. While this
    murdering was going on, the head men of the lower Klamath Indians,
    went to the Humboldts and told them to make a break and run and hide
    in the brush, for they might just as well perish in that way as be all
    killed by the brutal soldiers. So a good many of them made good their
    escape, wandering through the woods and the Klamath Indians picked up
    many of them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span> and took care of them for a number of years, while many
    of them died from exposure and starvation. I have seen the bones of
    quite a number where they had died in the heavy redwood timber, and
    the soldiers took what Indians were left to the Hoopa Reservation. The
    Indians here did not like them and they had no way to gather provisions
    on which to live, and no way to doctor or take care of the sick, no
    sanitation by which to keep clean. Once a week two or three pounds
    of flour was given out to each family to live or die on. The Klamath
    Indians would buy beef from the agent and give it to them to keep them
    from starving, and when things became more quiet, the Klamath Indians
    took the most of them that they had picked up, and took them to Hoopa,
    to their own people, and left them there. After this had dwindled
    down to a mere nothing, by the help of the lower Klamaths a few got
    back to Humboldt Bay, their ancient home. To finish them up, as they
    were having a festival on what is now called Gunther Island, just
    north of Eureka, a crowd of six or eight white men, took a canoe and
    slipped over there in the night with axes, club and knives and murdered
    innocent men, women and children, which nearly exterminated the once
    great and numerous tribe of Indians, known as the Humboldts, and by the
    lower Klamath Indians, as the Way-yets. One influential Humboldt Indian
    and his family, was kept safely at Pec-wan village, by Wetch-ah-wah,
    (my own father) and after everything was quiet on Humboldt Bay,
    Wetch-ah-wah brought him and his family back to their home, where he
    lived peaceably for many years, having died only a few years previous
    to this writing. Today there are not more than twenty or less Indians
    living, and what are left, have lost completely all their old and
    ancient customs and teachings. They never had only the most spurious
    ideas of the Talth Order, when they were placed here by Wah-pec-wah-mow
    (God), and given their country and language. Sometimes it seems hard to
    think of man’s inhumanity, but as sure as the sun goes down, the white
    man will suffer for his wicked treatment of the Humboldt Indians.</p>

  <div class="subhead">THE ROMANCE OF A WILD INDIAN.</div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THIS happened during the early years of my grandmother’s life, and
    concerns principally a family at Reck-woy village, at the mouth of the
    river. On the south side of the river is a village named Wealth-quow,
    and at this place the Indians gave a large entertainment, where many
    guests had assembled to take part in the dance. This dance is commonly
    known in the English language, as the “Brush Dance.” The Indians always
    begin dancing these dances after sundown, and sometimes dance until
    late at night. Large crowds had gathered at this dance, and among the
    guests were three girl friends from across the river at Reck-woy, who
    joined the dancers in their usual custom of holding a bunch of brush
    over their faces, so no one would know who they were. All the dancers,
    both men and women hold the bunch of brush over their faces, after the
    fashion of a masquerade ball. While the dancers were making merry two
    wild Indians came in and joined them, with the brush over their faces
    and nobody knew who they were. When the dancers finished for a short
    intermission, the three Reck-woy girls left the room and went down to
    the foot of the hill, about thirty yards away where a spring gushed
    out of the hill-side. Laughingly they had gone to get a drink of nice
    cold water from the spring, and wash their faces in the cool refreshing
    water. As they left the house the two wild Indians followed them down
    to the spring, and upon reaching it, they sprang upon one of the girls,
    named Os-slock-o-may and captured her, covering her mouth with their
    hands so she could not scream for help, and the other two girls made
    their escape back to the house to give the alarm. Everything being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
    favorable for the wild Indians, as the thickets grew high and dense,
    and the forests being near, they were soon lost in the inky shadows
    of the big trees, where they carried their captive. The two Indians
    traveled with the girl all night, going in a southerly direction away
    from the river, and as they went along through the darkness, she would
    take small pieces of her buck skin apron and tie them to the bushes,
    thus making a trail which aided her followers for a long distance. When
    the alarm was given that Os-slock-o-may had been captured by the wild
    Indians, the guests did not dance any more, and all the men who were
    able, went in pursuit of the wild Indians, to rescue the girl. They
    lost her among the dark shadows of the trees, as they could not find
    any trail to follow that night, and the next morning they all started
    out in hot pursuit, soon finding the trail she had left, The girl’s
    supply of strings had become exhausted and therefore had no means of
    leaving any further trace of the direction her captors were taking her.
    However, they searched the hills, creeks and mountains for several
    days, but never found her trail again, and she was given up to the
    wilds, and the procession turned homeward, very sad and heart broken.</p>

  <p>Somewhere in the depths of a dark canyon among the redwoods, the wild
    Indians had carried Os-slock-o-may. When they reached their hiding
    place, one of the Indians made her his wife, after the fashion of a
    primeval wedding. The wild Indians are always very rich in all kinds
    of Indian wealth, and this wild Indian dressed his bride in the most
    beautiful of Indian dresses, made of buck skin and ornamented with
    shells, and lavished wealth upon her. A little son came to their home
    in the wilds, of which they were both very proud, and they watched
    the little baby grow into a robust, handsome little fellow, who by
    nature inherited the ways of his father, as soon as he was big enough
    to walk and talk. He would run away from his mother and skip among the
    trees, romp among the bushes and seemingly never grow tired of his wild
    revelry; he would talk and whistle to himself, and this grieved his
    mother very much, as she had tried every plan to subdue him from his
    wild romping but of no avail. When the boy was about six years of age,
    his mother became very lonesome for her people, and wished very much
    to see them again, so one day she summoned up the courage to ask her
    husband to allow her to return to her home on a visit, as she said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span> her
    folks were mourning for her as lost, having given up hopes of seeing
    her alive. He consented to let her go home on a visit, and that she
    could take her little boy with her, so they began to make ready for
    the journey as it was a long distance, and the country was very rough.
    The O-ma-ha (Devil) husband who was immensely rich, dressed his wife
    in one of the most beautiful of Indian dresses, and the little boy was
    also richly clad, and so they started on their journey to Reck-woy. The
    wild man guided and accompanied them until they neared the village of
    Wealth-quow, the village from which he had stolen her on the night of
    the dance, and here as they came into a small open space over-looking
    the village, he parted from his wife and little son, and they crossed
    the river and went into her native village. As she entered the village
    she was most beautiful to behold, dressed in the most gorgeous Indian
    dress, with her little son by her side, and startled friends and
    relatives, who had mourned her as dead, greeted her with much surprise
    as they had mourned her loss for nearly nine years. Her folks were
    over-joyed to find their long lost child restored to them, and with
    hearty greetings and a royal welcome, she found herself back in the
    village of her birth. With breathless interest they sat listening to
    her wonderful tales concerning her life in the solemn wilds, how she
    had been carried over mountain and crag, and through the huge forests,
    to a strange home in the cave in a cliff of rocks, where one of the
    wild men had made her his wife. In this strange cave she had enjoyed
    the comforts of a luxuriant home, for her husband was exceedingly rich
    and was very kind to her and their child. From her description it
    seemed this cave was located at the source of Redwood Creek, which we
    call Cho-lu-wer-roy, in a dark canyon, which is perhaps over a distance
    of sixty miles from Reck-woy, off in a southerly direction. In a cave
    of this dark canyon, surrounded on every side by the giant redwoods,
    she had spent nine years of her life, listening to the sigh of the wind
    among the trees and strange enchantment of the babble of the brooks
    down the rocky canyon. Safe in her cave and lonely, with nothing but
    nature and a wild man to comfort her, she had grown more lonely as the
    years crept by in her desire to see her people once more. How they
    had traveled on their journey back along the creek beds for a long
    distance, over high mountains and around sheer walls of great bluffs,
    and through the awful calm of dense forests<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span> and overhanging thickets,
    she had at last reached the home of her birth. Parting from her devoted
    husband for the first and last time, she faithfully promised to meet
    him again at the close of her visit, and return with him again to the
    cave in the wilds. During the first days of her visit she encouraged
    her boy to associate with the children of the village. But he could
    not resist the calling of that wild nature he had inherited from
    his father, and all of his mother’s pleadings proved of no avail in
    changing his character. He would watch his opportunity and run away
    from the other children and play by himself, among the dense bushes,
    jumping and whistling as he would go. His mother gave up in despair in
    her efforts to change his ways.</p>

  <p>She remembered the day and place where she had promised to meet her
    husband, and return with him to their home, but she refused to go
    and meet him at the appointed time and place, as she said she never
    intended to return, and had merely made him the promise in order to
    get back to her people, and now that she was with them she would never
    leave them again.</p>

  <p>He waited in vain at the appointed place as she came not to meet him,
    and after waiting a long time he came to the conclusion that she had
    made him a false promise, so he crept cautiously down to the river, and
    swam across to Reck-woy village, where he knew his wife was staying.
    When he reached the other side, he crept up the hill-side and concealed
    himself in a dense clump of bushes, where he could look down upon the
    house where he knew she was staying, and watched for her. His wife
    seldom ventured out of the house, as she was afraid that he would
    get her again, so she kept close indoors that he might not have any
    chance of getting her away again. One day he managed to attract the
    attention of his little son, and he came up to his father and they
    talked together, he directed the son to go and tell his mother to come
    to him, as he was waiting for her. When the son delivered the message
    to his mother, she replied that she did not believe this to be true,
    so he returned to his father, telling him what his mother had said. He
    immediately sent him back to her, imploring that she come to him, the
    mother looked puzzled at the boy, and said that he must be mistaken,
    but he said that he knew his father, and pleaded earnestly for her to
    return to their home in the canyon. Studying the boy’s eager face a few
    moments, she replied by saying that he could choose between her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span> and
    his father, he could remain with her, or go with his father, back into
    the lonesome wilds. The boy at once preferred his father and bade his
    mother farewell. Father and son returned to their hiding place, and
    the mother, who had once cheered them in the lonesome wilds, never saw
    them again, they had gone out of her life forever, like a dream that
    had come and gone, and faded again, with the closing day, back into the
    primeval redwoods, where you may see father and son straying together
    among the mystic shadows of dream-land mountains.</p>

  <p>When the Indians are dancing for pleasure, such as they did in the
    brush dance, and any one wants them to dance faster and harder, they
    shout to the dancers: “hal-o-may-yah,” which means dance harder.
    In this kind of dancing the word “dance” is called “o-may-like.”
    But in the sacred dances, such as the Lodge Dance, it is called,
    Wah-neck-wel-la-gaw, and has a different meaning altogether.</p>

  <div class="subhead">THE PROPHET WHO FAILED.</div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THIS Indian was a Smith River, and the Klamath Indians in their tongue,
    called him, He-na Tom. In the year about eighteen hundred and sixty
    five, this He-na Tom, while living at his home on Smith River, which
    is north from the Klamath River, his wife became sick and died, and
    he mourned her loss greatly. In the fall he had a prophetic dream,
    which caused him to commence a sort of revival among the Smith River
    Indians, telling them to destroy everything they had ever received
    from the white people, discard all the clothing, houses and in fact,
    burn all and everything, and go back to their old Indian way of living
    entirely, and in a short time all the dead Indians would come back to
    life, to this world. As it happened He-na Tom had a sister, that was
    married to a Klamath River man, and they had a family of grown sons and
    daughters, and this family lived in a village called Ni-galth, which
    is situated on the west side of the Klamath River, opposite the mouth
    of Blue Creek, some eight miles down the river from where the Klamaths
    hold their White Deer-Skin Dance. So in the fall, after the Klamaths
    had finished putting in the fish dam, and the Indians from all parts
    of the country had been invited to come and see the ceremony, and the
    White Deer-Skin Dance was going on, He-na Tom made his appearance
    among them with his sayings, telling them to destroy all their white
    man’s goods, burn all the houses that were made in the white man’s
    way, and tear down all their Indian houses, but not to burn the lumber
    of the Indian houses, thus leaving a clear opening, and for all of
    them to bring all their Indian money and wealth of all kinds, and hang
    it up in plain view, around<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span> him where he was lying, covered with
    Indian blankets made of deer skin. He told them to go ahead with the
    White Deer-Skin Dance, so when the dead ones appeared, they would all
    dance with them and make a big jubilee, and all of them who failed to
    comply with his holy orders, and not bring their valuables, that it
    would all turn into rock or rocks, and those that disbelieved and did
    not come, would themselves turn to rock. He had a great many of the
    Klamath Indians of the wealthy class, all of the poor class, and a few
    of the high class that was wild and willing to follow, and there was
    a lot of valuable property and things destroyed, while the shelves or
    tables were loaded with provision for the dead when they came, so they
    could eat, dance and all be joyful, while all the white people were
    to turn to rocks. Some of the wise ones of the high class, that were
    versed in the secret mysteries, hung back saying no, that they wanted
    to see. While they were claiming that He-na Tom had gone to meet the
    dead Indians, and that he would be back with them that night, three or
    four of the doubtful ones went over to where the large piles of Indian
    blanket were by a fire, and on lifting up the blankets behold, there
    was He-na Tom. They spoke to him, calling him by name, but he did not
    answer, his followers claimed that his body was there, but that his
    spirit had gone to meet the dead ones. When the old ones who were so
    highly versed in the mysteries as not to be hoodwinked, had seen enough
    to convince them that there was no truth in it, they shook their heads,
    quietly moved back and retired to their camps or homes, saying that
    He-na’s prophesies were a fake, and that he was a humbug. As it turned
    out, that night He-na Tom slipped down the Klamath River, to the mouth,
    and up the coast, back to Smith River, his home. So when the Klamaths
    came to gather back their valuables, there was considerable of it that
    the rightful owners could not find, and never did get back, which made
    many of them very angry.</p>

  <p>He-na Tom’s brother-in-law was afterwards killed, and all of his
    Klamath relations were compelled to leave the Klamath River, and go to
    Smith River to live for a number of years before they dared to return
    to the Klamath again. I have long since found that the Klamath Indians
    are bad fellows, for any one to try to play fake on. They have, or used
    to have, their wise ones, that watched the different positions of the
    planets, at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span> different seasons of the year, and tell of hard winters,
    of cold or warm summers, and of different harvest famines. They
    sometimes had dreams that they interpreted for good or bad. Other than
    this I have never heard of them ever having prophets.</p>

  <p>Since the white race of people, that they found inhabiting the Klamath
    when they first arrived there, which we call the Wa-gas, which must
    have been thousands of years ago, they do not tell of ever having
    come in contact with any kind of a white race, or of any other race
    ever coming among them until the present white race came, which we
    call Ken-ne-ah. The Klamath River is so inaccessible, winding its way
    through high mountains, with no valleys, that to this day it is a wild
    country with lots of game and fish. And there never has been a Preacher
    of any kind among us to this day.</p>

  <div class="subhead">TEACHINGS OF THE KLAMATH INDIANS ON CHILD-BIRTH.</div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE Klamath Indians say that a child born at the time the sun is at
    the farthest north and on the point which it is to turn back south,
    or as the white man counts time, would be in the month of December
    and which we count the tenth month, and call Cah-mo, is the worst and
    most objectionable time we have for a child to be born, most of them
    die young or in infancy, and if they live they are of little use to
    themselves or the tribe. A child born in the time in which the acorns
    fall, which would be from the tenth of October to the twentieth of
    November, and which time or month we call Can-na-wal-at-tow, is the
    best or one of the best times, as these children are nearly all bright,
    healthy and prosperous, and make the leading ones. While children born
    in April, May and June, as we count the time, also make good, healthy
    and bright men and women, and also the leading ones. Children born
    between the twentieth of July and the first of September, which we call
    Cher-wer-ser-a, are weakly and do not live long, most of them dying
    young, but if they do live they are foolish and not of any use to their
    people. Those that are born in the time the white man designates as
    October, May and June, are the ones that receive the prayers of the
    mother, grand parent and wise old heads of the tribe, and all look
    forward to their being useful to the tribe, particularly those that
    are of the high families. The Klamath Indians are a people that are at
    any, and all times, praying to the great father of all, and are pleased
    when a new baby is born. They take the best<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span> of care of the mother in
    child-birth, but if a woman brings into the world a child that is dead
    or still-born, she is looked down upon and is almost cast aside, and
    has a hard time to pull through. If she dies in the struggle, there is
    but little sympathy for her loss, and if she lives, she is ever after
    called Cam-ma-gay, so that any and all may know her, and if she is
    a married woman and has had children and saved them, and afterwards
    brings one into the world dead, she is always afterwards called
    Quirk-ker-alth.</p>

  <p>In all my life among them I have never seen but few of these women, but
    do know some that have met with this misfortune. The Klamath Indians
    are the best in the world at handling their women in child-birth, in
    the old Indian way.</p>

  <div class="subhead">THE WILD INDIAN OF PEC-WAN.</div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THIS happened at my birth place and about one mile up the Klamath River
    from my mother’s birthplace, at Wah-tec village both places being on
    the north side of the river. At Pec-wan village, there comes down from
    the east and north, a creek that enters into the Klamath River, at
    or near Pec-wan village, and is called Pec-wan Creek. This creek has
    three forks, the north, middle and south forks, the south fork being
    the largest one. The mountain rises to a height of about four or five
    thousand feet at the head of the south fork, and nearly the whole of
    the country of Pec-wan, is covered with a dense growth of large timber
    and thick brush. In this vast forest of timber, there are sloping flats
    on the creek, and up the sides of the mountain there is oak timber, the
    acorn, from which we make our bread, and which we call pop-saw. In the
    Fall, which is the last part of October, and on through the month of
    November, sometimes later, there was a family moved back on the south
    fork, to a picking place. At these camps they most always have houses,
    sometimes they are made of cedar bark and sometimes of boards, but they
    are made tight and comfortable, so if there comes a rain they can keep
    dry and warm, particularly the women and children. After they had been
    there for sometime and had gathered a quantity of acorns, there came
    some wild Indians (Oh-mah-hah) around on the outside of the houses,
    and as there was quite a number of young men in the camps, the girls
    were closely watched by the men, and were not much afraid of the wild
    men. The men would go outside and holler at the Oh-mah-hahs to come
    into the house, so that they could see them, but they were afraid to
    come in, only watching a chance to steal one of the girls, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span> take
    her away for a wife. After the Indians had gathered as many acorns as
    they thought they wanted, they concluded to go back to their homes,
    but two of the large, strong and athletic young Pec-wans, said they
    were going to remain in the camp, and hide in one of the houses. The
    rest all got ready and started home, leaving the two young men, who
    climbed up to the frame, where the platform is fixed, that they put
    the large basket plates, filled with the acorns on, that are hulled,
    so as to dry them, over where they make the fire to cook and warm by,
    the heat going up through the platform and plates, drying the acorns;
    so the young men secreted themselves up there for they could not be
    seen, and kept very still. In the evening the Wild Indians came, and
    not seeing or hearing anyone, supposed that all had left the camp,
    and after spying around awhile, an Oh-mah-hah ventured into the house
    and sat down by the fire-place, and opened a buck-skin sack, which we
    call ac-gure, and which has sticks inside to act as stays, to hold it
    in shape, it being twelve or fourteen inches long, and carry it under
    the arm, each one of these wild men had one of these sacks, which is a
    sort of a magic wand, and in this, they carry different kinds of herbs.
    Some of which are very good for a person’s health, and some act like
    magic for poison, and with it they can kill any one they wish. Now this
    wild man after sitting down, opened his sack, and took out each kind
    of herbs or roots, saying as he lifted each one out, what it was good
    for, and after he had taken part of them out and laid them by the side
    of the ac-gure, he thought he heard a noise, so leaving his ac-gure
    and the roots, he ran outside, at this the young Pec-wans jumped down
    from their hiding place, and grabbed up the ac-gure and put the roots
    back into it, immediately after this the wild man returned and begged
    and pleaded with them, to give them back, but they refused to do so.
    He told them they could not use it unless they were taught the art, by
    which to use it. Then they wanted him to teach them, but he said he
    never would, so they told him they would keep it. After he had begged
    and talked for awhile, they started home taking the ac-gure with them,
    and the wild man following and pleading in every way for them to return
    the sack to him. As they kept on towards home, the Oh-mah-hah told them
    if they would return it to him, he would cause any one that they might
    wish for, to die, and would give them half of all he had, but they
    refused, and kept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span> on until they reached home. The wild man went with
    them into the house, and they fed him, and every time they went out, he
    went with them. Sometimes they would go for wood for the sweat-house,
    and he would follow them closely, always pleading for his ac-gure and
    acting so simple, that it seemed this ac-gure was his whole life. They
    were determined never to give it back to him, and so one morning they
    concluded to make a big fire in the sweat-house, put him inside, fasten
    the door, and smoke him to death. They kept the ac-gure, and they say
    this family, was ever after, very lucky in getting deer and other game,
    as they had the Wild Indian’s devil.</p>

  <p>This is the only time, where they caused a Oh-mah-hah to die, that I
    know of. These sweat-houses, are sure an ideal place, to smoke a person
    to death in.</p>

  <div class="subhead">HOW THE RICH TRIED TO BE A TALTH.</div>

  <p class="drop-cap">I will give the history of one Indian that was very wealthy, who
    belonged to the He-na’s. (Smith Rivers) This Indian while yet a very
    young man, had by inheritance, been left so much wealth that he felt
    there was no part or place, but what he had the right and power to go,
    and being closely related to some of the wealthy families of the lower
    Klamath, and among the rest to a family of one of the Talths, which
    lived at Wah-tec village, close to where the White Deer-Skin Dance
    is held. When it came time for this dance, he took with him a great
    many of his most valuable articles to use in the dance. He went up to
    Reck-woy, the mouth of the Klamath, and on up to Wah-tec to visit with
    his relatives, and take part in the dance, by putting his valuables
    in. Everything went along merrily to his satisfaction until the dance
    was finished at Wah-tec village. The day all was in readiness to move
    down to the place where they all make a stop, and only those that have
    a high birth are allowed to travel on the lower trail and go to the
    place that is held sacred ground, and here, when he was told not to
    go, he said, “why I am richer than any one here, I can go any place,”
    then when some of his relatives told him to stay back, that he could
    go on the upper trail with the others that were rich, he protested
    strongly and still persisted in going, but was told plainly that his
    riches counted for nothing at this time and place. That with all his
    riches, he was of low birth, that his mother and father were married
    in the low marriage, and that he was of the He-na tribe, and that he
    could give his riches to one that was born right, to take there for
    him if he wished to do so, or he could take his riches with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span> him on
    the upper road, to be used on up the hill, and at the finishing place.
    At this he cowed down like a child and wept, leaving all of his wealth
    and started back into the mountains, back to the very highest mountains
    where the bear, panther and wolves were plentiful. All alone he went
    to where there is a large rock which we call Hah-i-o-claw, and he
    remained there for three days singing and praying, then with nothing to
    eat he wandered on through the wild timber and brushy country, back to
    Crescent City, (Caw-pay) and proclaimed himself a doctor, and always
    was known afterward as Caw-pay or Crescent City Doctor and lived to be
    old, and all of the old time white inhabitants of Crescent City well
    remember this Indian that went by the name of Crescent City or Caw-pay
    Doctor. He was an oddity and many are the jokes that the old time white
    men, and some of the white women played on him. I am related to him
    and knew him well, and the place where he claimed he went to the large
    rock, and I will say that it is a wild country, in which there are
    plenty of wild animals. I have been on this mountain often and seen the
    land marks that were left there by the white race on going north.</p>

  <div class="subhead">THE SLAVES.</div>

  <p class="drop-cap">Among the Klamath Indians there were many slaves, which we called
    Ki-elth, when the white man first came to our country. These slaves
    came about in many ways. Some were mixed blood of Klamath and Hoopas,
    some were all Hoopas, and some were mixed blood of the Klamath and
    Smith River’s, and consisted of both men and women, but most of them
    were Klamaths themselves. Slavery was brought about by wars, famines,
    and contagious diseases. In case of a famine there would be a shortage
    of acorns, and no run of salmon in the river for two or three years,
    and sometimes longer, when the winters were long and cold, or dry,
    with but little rainfall. All the land and fishing places belonged to
    the wealthy families, who would gather it all for themselves, leaving
    little or none for the poor families, which would leave whole families
    hungry and starving. They would go to some rich man’s house and offer
    themselves as slaves, and these offers were usually accepted. In other
    cases there would be sickness start in a well-to-do family, and often
    be a death or doctor bills to pay, and no chance to gather acorns or
    fish or hunt until they would be reduced to poverty and become hungry
    and offer themselves as slaves to some rich family or some big doctor,
    which was most of the time accepted. (This is something like what the
    white doctor is doing today among his own people.) Sometimes in war or
    fighting they would take them and let them be slaves in other ways. Now
    these wealthy families would have very large and commodious houses,
    and a house would be full to over-flowing in numbers and all would be
    mixed up in conversation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span> and at the time of eating the slaves were
    first waited on, while their own children sat back or helped to attend
    to their wants, and they were served with as good as their own family
    had, and were treated in a way that made them feel at perfect ease in
    every way. Often times when the houses would become too crowded they
    would build another house and let them move into it, as these wealthy
    families kept close touch with their relations or kindred so as not to
    marry those that were their own kindred. Sometimes there were families
    that had slaves that were not good to them, fed them poorly and refused
    to doctor them. These are not hard to select, as one will hear it
    mentioned at all times. I have seen and known many of them that were
    slaves and were born of slave parents, and some of these slaves were
    so well treated by their masters that they at this time claim kindred
    with the children of the masters and the families of the masters are
    so tender in speaking to them of it that they do not let them know,
    unless they become too familiar or make the claim too bold, when a few,
    very few words will halt them in their claim for all time. These slave
    children are the kind that are mostly the Indians that are left today,
    and trying to make themselves and the white man believe that they
    know the true legends of the Klamath Indians, when in truth they do
    not know, and what they do know, such as not being allowed in certain
    places, and their birth and so on, they deny to the whites so as to
    hide their once low standing.</p>

  <p>These slaves were married off, and any and all were allowed to redeem
    themselves, to buy their freedom. Many in war times, for bravery and
    daring deeds gained their liberty, and after gaining it would be
    successful, become rich and buy back their brothers and sisters, or
    a part of them that they liked best; and after a long time, by good
    marriage, they could get their family back to a good standing among the
    people, but they are kept close track of through the generations and
    can never get to where one of them can become a Talth and go through
    the secrets of the lodge or order. They must be of free born parentage
    for all time before they are admitted to be a Talth. By this the reader
    can understand that only the learned ones are competent to give the
    true legends of their people, just as it is with the whites or other
    people.</p>

  <div class="subhead">THE WILD INDIAN OF MO-RECK.</div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THIS happened many years ago at the village of Mo-reck, which is
    situated on the north bank of the Klamath River, just below where we
    put in the fish dam. Up to within a few years ago there lived in this
    village a family named Plats who had three boys, one of which became
    sick and died, and in burying him they followed out the old and ancient
    custom.</p>

  <p>The house in which the family resided was very old, and the name of
    the house was Plats-ah-chene, the boys were called Plats-ots-ene, and
    the family was very rich. When the rich bury their dead they often put
    more less valuables in and on the grave, and they did in this case. The
    sand is put over the grave and kept dry by a board, so they can at any
    time by looking at the grave, see if any one has been meddling with it,
    or robbing the grave of the valuables, which has been done many times.
    So the other two brothers of the dead boy noticed one day that things
    did not look just right, and on a close examination they discovered
    that it had been robbed, and after fixing the grave they kept watch for
    the person or persons that done it, as there was left a part of the
    valuables in and on the grave. So early one night as they were sitting
    close to the grave, they heard a noise and kept very still, soon they
    saw a man moving along like a shadow in the dark. This wild Indian
    seemed to feel the presence of the watchers and kept moving stealthily
    around, but was afraid to come up to the grave. So finally the wild
    Indian (Oh-mah-hah) left and went down to the river and swam across to
    the other side, landing just below the Cap-pell village. One of the
    brothers cautiously followed behind, telling the other brother to go up
    the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span> river on the north, and keep on the old trail, and keep a close
    watch and see if the wild Indian tried to swim back somewhere above
    Cap-pell, while he took a boat, crossed the river and kept close to
    the Indian, who went up the river and swam back to the north side just
    below the village of Wah-say. So the brother on the north side went
    too far up the river and missed the Indian, so when he arrived at the
    village of Ma-reep and took a boat and crossed over to the south side
    just below Ma-reep, and remained there on the south side by a large
    hollow fir tree, which is called Ta-po, and close to the trail, thus
    the two brothers were both on the south side. The Indian on the north
    side became afraid and worked his way up the river until he came nearly
    opposite Ca-neck, and then swam across to the south side again. As he
    was dodging from tree to tree, as was the way of these wild Indians,
    he came up to the large fir tree. The brother that was in the hollow
    of the tree made a quick grab and caught him with a firm hold, and as
    he was wrestling with him the other brother came to his assistance
    and together they held and tied him fast to the fir tree. This Indian
    was painted all black with some kind of a mixture of pitch and other
    ingredients. He begged to be let loose and offered to give them half
    he had, also if they had any enemies to tell him and he would cause
    them to become sick and die. This Indian had the ac-gure sack which he
    carried under his arm but refused to give it to them, telling them that
    they would soon die as they did not know how to handle it, and he would
    sooner die himself than tell them how to handle it. So the two brothers
    left him tied to the tree after trying to persuade him to give them the
    sack, and in the morning they went home, thinking that their folk might
    become alarmed at their long absence. Upon their arrival they told
    what they had done, and after eating they went back to the Indian and
    began another bargain with him. At this he agreed to give them all the
    wealth he had if they would let him go, but he still refused to give up
    the ac-gure sack, as it contained poison, and a charm which they could
    never use unless he told them how, and this he would never do. So they
    finally agreed to take his wealth and let him go, so he led them to his
    home which was west and south to a place on Redwood Creek, where there
    was a cave in a clump of large rocks, some twenty-five miles from their
    home.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span> When they went into this cave-house they found that he had great
    wealth stored there, and they took it all home, leaving him there with
    his ac-gure to gather up more wealth with, and he was never seen again.</p>

  <p>The Klamath Indians never kill these Wild Indians, but in many cases
    where they had caught them, they most always found that they were rich
    by robbing graves of wealthy people, and that they always had the
    ac-gure. The wealth that these two Mo-reck Indians received from this
    Wild Indian made the Mo-reck village so rich that it never afterwards
    had to ask help from any one to carry their part through any of the
    great festivals. These Wild Indians are evidently a former part of our
    own cast-off people and of late years have entirely disappeared and the
    Indians are wondering what has become of them. Some think they have
    gone back into the tribe in other places or went out and mixed with the
    present white people so as not to be known by them.</p>

  <div class="subhead">HOW A COR-TEP GIRL HAD HER WISH GRANTED.</div>

  <p class="drop-cap">About sixty years ago there lived a girl in the Cor-tep village by the
    name of Mee-cher-us-o-may, and her parents urged her to marry a young
    man who lived farther up the river at the village of Mor-eck. (I have
    forgotten his name.) The girl did not like the man, yet her parents
    kept urging her to marry him against her will. There was two of her
    girl friends that was going down the river to Reck-woy, so she got
    into the boat or Indian canoe with them and started down the river. As
    they glided along Mee-cher-us-o-may kept wishing that some wild animal
    would take her, kill her and eat her. When they got to a place called
    Hay-way-gaw they all camped out on the bank of the river, back some
    twenty yards or more from the waters edge. The canoe was pulled up on
    the sloping sand so as to make it safe for the night, then they made a
    fire, cooked their evening meal and then talked until it was time to
    go to bed. All this time Mee-cher-us-o-may was wishing some harm would
    come to her. The three girls made their bed for the night so that all
    three could sleep together and when they went to bed Mee-cher-us-o-may
    slept in the center, so all went to sleep. In the morning she was
    missing, she got her wish. She had been taken from between the other
    two girls, and on examination they could see very plainly where a wild
    animal had dragged her over the dry sand, down to the edge of the
    water, into the river and disappeared with her, and she was never seen
    again. They thought an animal of the leopard species took her as some
    of the animals have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span> seen a number of times on the lower Klamath,
    and the Indians are very much afraid of them. This happened when I was

  <div class="subhead">OUR TOBACCO.</div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE white race of people that the Klamath Indians found in this land
    had a weed they called tobacco, which we call Hah-koom, and taught them
    to use it by smoking it in the pipe and to cultivate it by selecting a
    proper place, pile brush over the ground and then burn it, which would
    leave the ground with a loose layer of wood ashes. Over this, while the
    ashes were yet dry and loose, they would sow the seed and protect the
    crop by putting around it a brush fence. From year to year they would
    select from the best stalks seed for the next year and at times to hold
    the seed for a number of years if necessary, for if kept properly it
    will grow after being kept for a long time. The only thing that will
    bother or destroy the crop of tobacco is the deer and they often jump
    over the brush fence and eat every part of the crop, even to the roots.</p>

  <p>When an Indian takes his pipe to smoke he inhales the smoke and keeps
    it in his lungs for ten or fifteen seconds and then blows it out
    through his nose mostly, some through the mouth and then he gives a
    slow grunt, saying a few words in a plain audible tone. These words
    are to the Wa-gas the white people we loved so well, wishing that the
    Wa-gas, would give them good luck, long life, that they could see them
    come back or that they themselves could go to see them and be with
    them, and many other kinds of wishes for the Wa-gas. The old women
    doctors use tobacco very freely and have pipes that hold a handful of
    tobacco at a single smoking, and they ask the Wa-gas to give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span> them good
    luck in curing a sick person. The doctors are about the only ones of
    the women that smoke. The Indians have the most complete control over
    themselves and can smoke one, two or three times a day, or quit for a
    week or longer without a murmur.</p>

  <div class="subhead">OUR MERMAIDS.</div>

  <p class="drop-cap">THE Klamath Indians tell of the Mermaid that they said could be seen at
    night come and sit on a rock out in the middle of the river, at a place
    called Ca-neck. This rock is in a rocky and rough place in the river,
    some thirty miles up the river from its mouth, and some nine miles
    above where the White Deer-Skin Dance is held. This rock is in the
    middle of the river and the water in the summer time, at the low stage,
    just covers the top of it. On each side are whirls and eddies which the
    Indians have used for fishing with dip nets for many generations. There
    was never more than two of these Mermaids seen at a time, but they have
    been seen many times in the generations gone. They had very long hair,
    and were half fish and half women, but it is not known whether they
    were male or female. They looked like women and would sit there combing
    their long hair for hours at a time, and as they went away one could
    see their long hair floating in the water. The Indians say that for
    the past twenty years or more, they have not seen them and think they
    have been washed away, or that the river has been filled by the gravel
    and debris from the mines, which have destroyed them. They also say
    that they never had any fear of the Mermaids, but looked upon them as a
    freak of nature. They could see them plainly in the summer months while
    fishing, when the moon was full and sometimes they would be only a few
    yards away from them. These Mermaids we call Squerth-tucks.</p>

  <div class="subhead">THE WOMAN OF SIN.</div>

  <p class="drop-cap">HUNDREDS of years ago a young man and his wife resided at what is
    called Tu-rep village, which is located on the south side of the
    Klamath River about six miles from its mouth. The Tu-rep bar on the
    river is very large, consisting of fifty or a hundred acres of rich
    and productive soil. This man’s wife before her marriage belonged at
    the Si-elth village, across the river from Tu-rep on the north side.
    They lived very happy together for a number of years, he being very
    kind to her in every way and never spoke in a cross manner at any
    time. As the years went by he began to drift away from her and their
    home, neglecting her more and more. It seemed that a soul affinity had
    come into his life, a woman at the Reck-woy village, at the mouth of
    the river, was enticing him away from his wife and home. He found a
    resistless charm in her serpent-like arms, and as the days went by he
    would tarry longer in her company and he would be loath to part with
    her at all. At last his wife was being left alone so much and neglected
    that she became suspicious that another woman had robbed her of his
    love. She found her suspicion to be true as her husband was now giving
    all of his attention to the woman at Reck-woy. The wife became very
    sad and broken hearted over her husband’s actions and unfaithfulness,
    and went about her work in a dispirited manner and her attitude and
    appearance became one of profound sadness.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span> In company she always
    seemed down hearted, as the same sad look was always upon her face,
    making her appear to the visitors as wretched and lonely.</p>

  <p>As the miserable wife spent the lonely days at Tu-rep village, the
    people decided to give a large entertainment a host of guests gathered
    to make merry. Among the crowd was a man from the Ur-ner village, which
    is nine or ten miles up the river at the mouth of Blue Creek. During
    the entertainment the Ur-ner man was attracted to the lonely Tu-rep
    wife who appeared to him to be very sad and lonely in the midst of such
    gaiety. He came over to where she was seated and began a conversation
    by exchanging a few remarks. He thought he might be wrong in addressing
    her so boldly, and started to walk away but something stirred his inner
    emotions strangely, so much so that he could not resist the temptation
    to return to her. This time after a few remarks he summoned up courage
    to inquire into her troubled life, as he said she seemed very lonely.
    Deeply impressed by his winning manner and kind words her confidence
    was easily won and she readily related to him her unhappy marriage and
    how unfaithful her husband had grown. He at once became more interested
    and listened patiently to her story of sorrow, and with his sympathetic
    words of comfort, strange emotions that had long been dead within her
    breast thrilled into life once more. She had become a victim of his
    beguiling words of comfort as he drew her into his arms of passionate
    love. Alone and together they planned a secret meeting place that her
    husband and the village folks might not know of their clandestine
    meetings.</p>

  <p>When the Tu-rep husband would go down the river to Reck-woy to bask
    in the love of the woman of his affections, his wife would wait until
    the darkness of night had cast its gloom over the village, when she
    would creep carefully forth from her dwelling and meet her lover. She
    had a long way to go up the Tu-rep bar from her house, and each step
    she would take, she would cover her foot-prints with stones. In this
    manner she would cover her tracks over, for a distance of at least one
    mile along the river bar and when she reached the upper end of the bar
    she would step out into the water, and as before she covered over her
    tracks with stones until she stepped into her lover’s boat.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span> The Ur-ner
    Indian would come across the river from the opposite bank and take her
    into his canoe and paddle back to what is known as Stah-win bar. This
    is also a large bar covered with huge redwoods. Together they would
    wander into the inky blackness of the huge redwoods where they would
    enjoy each other’s company until a late hour at night, when the Ur-ner
    man would again take his soul affinity into his canoe and return her
    to the upper end of Tu-rep bar, where she would leave him and proceed
    down the bar to her home, as before covering over her foot-prints with
    stones. She held these clandestine meetings with the Ur-ner Indian in
    that manner every time her husband would leave her and go to Reck-woy.
    After a while her husband became suspicious of her action, as when he
    returned home at night he never found her at home, yet he was very
    kind to her. He made every attempt to trace her footsteps but they
    were always lost upon the bar and all his efforts were futile. At last
    in desperation he made up his mind to try other plans to detect her
    mysterious whereabouts. He would start down the river on a pretence
    of going to Reck-woy, but would hide where he could see his wife’s
    movements around the house. This was kept up for sometime but he could
    not find out which way she had gone, but in his earnest endeavors
    to discover her whereabouts, one night he saw her covering over her
    foot-prints with stones as she went to meet her lover. Her shame and
    sin was at last discovered in spite of all her efforts and precaution
    to hide her disgrace from human knowledge. This covering of foot prints
    with stones is called in our language, “Way-nah-mah way-lap-po-lah
    hah-elth-werm-chelth,” which means covering the tracks of sin and
    shame with stones. To this day there can be seen at Tu-rep bar in the
    summer months when the waters of the river is low, the rows of stones
    that this sinful woman used to cover up her foot-prints of shame, and
    they stand out in strange relief along the waters edge where they were
    supposed to have been placed centuries ago by the woman of sin. The
    Indians point to these stones as a warning to all married women that
    no matter how secretly they sin against the marriage vows, they will
    be discovered sooner or later, and their sins will be reflected upon
    them throughout their lives. The moral of this story is to keep women
    from sinning and when they are tempted into sin that they are forever
    burdened with the heavy stones of disgrace that points to their sins
    and time cannot efface it.</p>

  <h3>WHAT HAPPENED TO TWO MA-REEP GIRLS</h3>

  <p>A number of generations back there lived in Ma-reep village a man and
    his wife with their three girls. The oldest of them was a good dutiful
    child, helped her mother in every way she could, while the other two
    were naughty, idle, cross and pouty. When it came time for their
    meals the oldest would eat and act like a perfect lady but the other
    two girls always kept up their naughty ways. They would go away in a
    corner and pout for more of this or that thing, and their mother kept
    telling them that if they did not stop being naughty, and act in a
    better manner and eat their meals properly, that a big owl would come
    and carry them off. They kept on until one night sure enough, a large
    owl came and took them and carried them about a mile down the river
    and placed them on a large, high rock, where they could not get down.
    They sat there and turned to stone, and are sitting there to this day
    and look like two little girls sitting up there. This rock we call
    Hoaks-or-reck and Klamath Indian mothers have been pointing to these
    two little stone girls, telling them this fairy tale to keep them from
    being naughty and to have them conduct themselves in a good, mannerly
    way. This rocks is close to the river on the north bank at the lower
    end of Ma-reep Rapids.</p>

  <h3>THE ADVENTURES OF A COYOTE.</h3>

  <p>Long ages ago a Coyote with his family resided at He-melth, which
    is a place on the Klamath River that is famous in Indian lore. One
    lovely day in early spring Mr. and Mrs. Coyote with all their children
    journeyed over the hills of the Klamath from He-melth to a place on
    the mountain side known as On-a-gap. This was a place where they went
    annually to gather green grasses upon which they would feast during
    the spring months. The family was camping out and having a good time.
    They kept on moving toward the mountain top when there suddenly came
    quite an unexpected snow storm, the weather turned freezing cold and
    Mr. and Mrs. Coyote did everything possible to save the lives of their
    children, but of no avail. One by one they perished in the cold snow
    as it kept snowing and falling very fast. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span> fond parents were left
    desolate and grief-stricken in the gloom of the storm, as they never
    could call back their loved ones. (The Coyote we call Say-yap.) As
    they laid the little bodies in their graves of snow, Mr. Coyote grew
    desperate over his great loss, and determined to seek revenge against
    the Sun. The Sun, he argued, heartlessly murdered his children, because
    it had refused to shine and give them warmth, so he started out at
    once upon one of the longest journeys ever made by any living animal.
    He chased the Sun over mountains, hills, through canyons, across vast
    plains and valleys, and past rivers and lakes, until he at last came to
    the ocean. Here he lost it, for it sank into the waves with a mocking
    laugh and left him standing alone upon the shores of darkness. Darkness
    closed around him with its mighty arms and he stood there on the shores
    of the restless ocean for several minutes in utter despair. Weary in
    body and limbs, and sad at heart for his great loss, the truth flashed
    upon him that he could never in this world get his revenge, as the
    being of his wrath was swift in its flight through space. Thus on the
    shore he stood, when he suddenly turned his back on the west with a
    kick of contempt in that direction, where the Sun (his great enemy) had
    sank. In silence he gazed towards the east and then away towards the
    northern horizon, and there in the far north he saw a more pleasing
    scene where he buried his great burden of sorrow. While he still stood
    there gazing he saw the seven stars winking down through the heavens
    at him, and they kept winking for him to join them. Suddenly he felt
    himself rising from the earth as if he had been transformed into an
    Angel with wings, and he rose far away to the Kingdom of Heaven. Up
    he soared, ever up, until he was at last flying among the seven stars
    and when he reached them, he began to dance and sing, as they were all
    girls and also sisters. They asked him not to keep on singing as they
    said he did not know how to sing properly and said they would teach
    him how to sing, so he could join them in some of their songs. So he
    became flattered to think that the sisters were taking so much interest
    in him and he became very vain at once, as some narrow minded people
    do, when they become associated with a superior circle. He was rather
    enthusiastic now, to think what a good escape he had made from the
    cruel earth to a beautiful abode in Heaven. He flattered himself so
    much in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span> wild enthusiasm that he thought himself very wise, and he
    would display some of his talent before the sisters. As they offered to
    teach him he replied to them, “I can sing beautifully; I used to sing
    for my wife and children down on the earth, they always said my voice
    was good and I believe I know a good deal about singing, and do not
    need any training. So never mind girls about teaching me for my voice
    is just splendid and I can sing perfectly.” The sisters looked at each
    other and felt very disappointed to think that the Coyote persisted
    in knowing all about the fine arts, when he practically did not know
    the first step. After some persuasion they decided they would never
    be able to teach him any of the fine arts of singing, for the stars
    of Heaven were much different from those on earth. They reasoned too,
    that perhaps he was out of his natural mind, after traveling so many
    millions of miles through space. The sisters replied as good naturedly
    as they could: “very well kind sir, we are deeply grieved to find that
    by our billion of years of experience and knowledge we are not able
    to teach you anything, and you may proceed as you like.” The Coyote
    began to dance and sing again among his friends until he grew very
    tired and when he could no longer sing and dance he began to talk to
    them in a broken tone. His head grew dizzy as his mind wandered from
    the songs and drifted into thought about himself. He kept repeating
    the words as he danced until he lost his pipe, tobacco pouch, belt and
    deer skin trousers, which caused the sisters to smile and wink among
    themselves. They tried to persuade him not to talk so much but he kept
    right on and would not heed them. They became very weary and bored
    over this stupid nonsense and the elder sister said they would join
    him in his revelry. One on each side of him took his hand in theirs,
    formed one large circle and began to dance and sing around him. They
    dragged him faster and faster until they whirled him as fast as they
    could go. His poor head was in a dizzy whirl and he began to fear for
    his safety, not knowing when they would let him rest, as it seemed they
    had been whirling him for centuries. They might go on whirling him for
    a thousand years, and he felt so famished and weak that he could not
    endure this treatment much longer. “Ouch!” he exclaimed in a terrible
    voice, “I say girls I cannot glide your fast whirls any longer, I am
    afraid I will fall down in a heap and die, or else my bones fly to
    pieces.” “So you shall fall in a heap<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span> Mr. Coyote,” exclaimed the girls
    in a loud chorus, “down with you to the earth from whence you came, as
    you are not a bright pupil here in heaven. Up here you must be very
    brilliant and you have always been stupid enough to think that you
    knew it all. We are weary of your revelry, so farewell, we wish you
    many happy days down on the earth and again we say farewell,” and they
    pushed him down from his place in Heaven. He fell so rapidly through
    space that he found it impossible to keep himself together and the
    bones of his body fell to pieces and went flying and whizzing in each
    direction, but some how they managed to fall in a heap at Ca-neck,
    which is a very ancient village and the most famous among my people for
    stories, as so many wonderful tales begin there. The Coyote’s bones
    laid bleaching in the sun for a short time near this village when a
    heavy rain storm caused the river to overflow its banks. The rising
    waters of the river took the Coyote’s bones and carried them down to
    the mouth of the river at Reck-woy where they were washed upon the
    sand beach. After being planted there in the sand for several days, a
    slender shoot sprang up and unfurled its green foliage above the sand.
    In time this slender shoot grew into a tall alder tree and the Coyote
    and his bones were now transformed into a tree. One day an old woman
    with her wood basket on her back and a stone hatchet in her hand came
    along the beach looking for some wood. She took a great fancy to this
    alder tree as she thought it would make good wood for the fire, it was
    just the kind of a tree she had been looking for, for some time, and
    was pleased upon finding it. So she began to chop it and to her great
    surprise the tree sprang from the earth and vanished in a flash and
    then took up the shape of a Coyote which stood before her. “Ouch!” he
    yelled in a loud voice, “go away, old woman, how dare you cut me to
    pieces like that?” The old woman became more frightened than ever, as
    she dropped her hatchet and ran for her life back to the village. She
    could not find any reason for such a strange encounter and came to the
    conclusion that it was some of the Indian devils trying to frighten
    her. The Coyote, to his great relief, was once more in his own natural
    body and he set out to travel upon the earth again. He ventured to the
    rabbits as he had a desire to visit them. Upon reaching the rabbit’s
    home he found Mrs. Rabbit away and only her small children there, upon
    entering the house he asked the children to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span> give him something to eat
    as he was very hungry, not having had anything to eat for a long time.
    The children were too young to understand what he was saying and all
    of them became frightened and ran out of the house. When they were
    all safely outside they set fire to the house in hopes of burning the
    Coyote to death, and he was busy inside, going through the shelves
    looking for something to eat. But as fortune favored him this time he
    heard the flames crackling in time to make his escape from a dreadful
    death. After his narrow escape he decided to go and stay with his
    grandmother at Weitchpec and he journeyed slowly up the river until
    he reached her home. As soon as he arrived there he had a long story
    to tell her, he said he was almost dead from hunger, as he had been
    on a long journey without any food and asked her to cook the best she
    could afford as he needed it to build up his strength again, and he
    also informed her that many of his cousins were coming to visit her. He
    explained to her that he had left them a few miles down the river to
    camp for the night and they had sent him ahead to tell her they were
    coming and for his grandmother to prepare a feast and be ready for
    them. She told him there was nothing to eat except Tur-perks, which
    are blighted acorns that fall to the ground and are worm eaten, that
    she was sorry for her guests but it was the best she could do. She at
    once set about cooking great basket-fulls of the tur-perks, as she
    never doubted but what her grandson was telling the truth. When these
    were cooked she placed the baskets on the table before the Coyote,
    never doubting but what he would leave plenty for his cousins to eat.
    She never dreamed that one small being could eat so much at one time,
    and was greatly disappointed and humiliated when she found that he
    had eaten all the acorns, even licking the baskets clean and dry. As
    he finished this large meal he heaved a sigh of relief, as it was the
    first meal he had eaten for over a hundred years, just how long ago he
    first left the earth to go to Heaven he could not remember. His cousins
    were not coming, he just wished to deceive his grandmother, that she
    might cook a great quantity so he could feast by himself. He deceived
    her for the first time very cleverly as she did not doubt the story
    of his cousins coming. After this meal the Coyote called to her and
    said, “I am going to fish tonight and if my luck is good our baskets
    will be filled by day-break, now my dear you may cook tonight another
    large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span> quantity of tur-pecks and tomorrow I will help you prepare the
    fish for cooking as I think my cousins will arrive at sunset. His
    grandmother still believed his story to be true but she was very tired
    and after he had gone to fish she decided to go to bed, thinking she
    would have plenty of time on the morrow to cook the tur-pecks for the
    cousins, as they were not coming until evening of the next day. When
    the Coyote reached the bank of the river he did not even pretend to
    fish but jumped from boulder to boulder and bruised his head and face
    as much as he could. Some time in the night he returned and repeated
    to her a pitiful tale of how some one had attacked him and given him
    a severe beating—of how some of the other people would not allow him
    to fish, etc. She listened patiently to his tale of woe and realized
    for the first time that he was telling her falsehoods. After he had
    finished his story she became very angry and gave him a severe scolding
    for being so deceitful. The Coyote did not stay with her very long as
    he wearied and annoyed her so much she planned to get rid of him. One
    day she hired a young man to take him across the river to the village
    of Peck-toolth where she instructed him to camp for the night. That
    night after dark the young man asked the Coyote to sleep at his feet,
    which the Coyote gladly did as he was somewhat tired from tramping
    through the woods that day and he was soon fast asleep. Then the young
    man quietly left the bed and rolled a log in the place he had been
    lying in. He did this to deceive the Coyote when he awoke, as he would
    most likely see the log and think he was still sleeping there, then he
    hurried away and left him asleep and alone at Peck-toolth. The Coyote
    woke up during the night and looked about him and soon discovered the
    log and that the young man had left him alone. He jumped to his feet
    hastily and ran down to the banks of the river, and when he arrived
    there he saw the young man standing on a high rock on the opposite
    side of the river, he yelled until he was hoarse for him to come over
    in his canoe and take him across to his grandmother’s. The young man
    refused to help him which made him very angry and he called him all the
    names he could think of and begged him in a pleading manner, but of no
    avail. At length the Coyote became so enraged that he yelled at the
    top of his voice that he would murder him if he ever reached him and
    he seized a sharp stone and ran up and down the river for a long time,
    swearing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span> as fast as he could utter his words. The man stood still
    on the rock with a mocking smile on his face and watched the frantic
    efforts of the Coyote, when he thought he was getting pretty tired the
    young man called out to him to swim across the river, he dared him and
    said it was easy to swim across. The Coyote at once took up the dare
    and plunged into the river and began to swim with all his might as he
    was compelled to swim against the current. He was almost successful in
    getting across when the young man shouted to him to look back across
    the river as there was something coming down the bank. The Coyote was
    foolish enough to look back over his shoulder, and as he did so the
    strong current swept him back on the same side he started from. He
    immediately made another desperate attempt to swim the river. He swam
    and swam, fighting against the strong current until he became exhausted
    and it was impossible for him to swim any longer. Realizing he would
    soon drown he called again and again to the young man to rescue him a
    boat, but the other stood immovable on the rock and calmly replied,
    “I cannot help you for your last day on earth has ended.” The Coyote,
    crying the mournful wail of death, sank into the waters of the river to
    rise no more.</p>

  <h3>A BEAR STORY.</h3>

  <p>Many years ago the Indians were warring among themselves at the village
    of Hop-paw, near the mouth of the river. A portion of them whipped the
    others and those who were defeated in the battle moved away from there
    and went back in the mountains to live, while the victorious warriors
    also left the Village for a few days’ stay at a place known as Si-alth.</p>

  <p>While the Indians were all away, a bear strayed into the village and
    went into one of the Indian houses where he discovered a very large
    basket filled with beautiful Indian dresses and strings of Indian money
    and other Indian ornaments. He was very happy when he discovered this
    basket and began to take the things out and look them over carefully.
    As he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span> came to the dresses he would try each one on and then dance, but
    he could not seem to find one that suited his idea of fashion. He kept
    on throwing the dresses aside as he pulled them off. He wanted one that
    rattled as he danced. At last he found the one he wanted, for when he
    put it on and danced the shells began to rattle, as there were a great
    many on the dress. As he danced, to his great delight, the shells rang
    like music in his ears, and well satisfied with the dress he pulled it
    off and put it back in the basket with all the other articles. After he
    had finished storing them away in the basket he began to tear up the
    earthen floor, and scatter things all over the house. After doing all
    the damage he could he shouldered the large basket and started for the
    woods, and traveled some distance to a large hollow redwood tree. He
    decided to stop here and put on the dress with many shells and put it
    on, and began to dance and sing, having a glorious time all by himself,
    as he had no comrades to join him in the fun. This is the song he sang
    while he danced: Ho-wen-ah-a, ho-wen-ah-a, nah-hay, nah-hay. After he
    had danced for some time, he became so tired that he could no longer
    sing. The dress began to weigh so heavily upon him that he became
    exhausted but he managed to keep on dancing, he loved to hear the music
    of the shells as he danced about.</p>

  <p>After visiting for several days at Si-alth the Indians returned to
    their homes at Hop-pow. When they reached the village they discovered
    that everything had been turned topsy-turvey in one of the houses, and
    that the large basket of Indian dresses were missing. They at once
    suggested that some of their enemies had returned while they were away
    and stolen the things, and they all followed in hot pursuit to recover
    the stolen articles. But they could find no trace of them, and in
    despair gave up the chase. Some of them made a closer inspection of the
    house and this time they were sure they saw bear tracks in the soft
    ground. The Indians now followed the bear tracks closely, which led
    them to the large redwood tree, and as they approached it they could
    see that it was hollow and had a large roomy place inside, and glancing
    in they saw the bear dancing, dressed in one of the dresses. One of
    the smaller boys became tired watching the bear and asked if he might
    go up near the tree and the older Indians decided to let him go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span> and
    asked him to try to get the dresses away from the bear. The boy agreed,
    and went up until he was afraid to go nearer. The bear’s attention
    was now attracted to the boy, and he saw at once that the Indians had
    discovered his hiding place, and stopped dancing and left the tree,
    carrying with him the Indian dresses, determined to take them to his
    own home, which was in a tree top near by. This tree was hollow up its
    trunk and in the top of this hollow the bear made his home. He tugged
    with all his might at the huge basket but it was so large he could not
    pull it through the hollow to his nest, and when he saw that he could
    not pull it through it made him mad and he tried to dig the tree up by
    the roots. He dug so rapidly that he soon found he had dug a cave under
    the tree, and being fatigued from his strenuous efforts he seized the
    basket and pulled it after him into the cave. Once in there he thought
    himself secure from the Indians. As the bear disappeared into the cave
    with the basket, all the Indians ventured up near the tree, they began
    talking as to what they would do, being very anxious to recover the
    things as it meant a great loss of riches if they could not recover
    them again. They finally agreed they would kindle a fire at the mouth
    of the cave and smoke the bear out of his den, so they gathered up a
    large pile of wood and dry branches and made a fire. The Indians lined
    up ready for him when he came out. The owner of the articles was an old
    man and he took his place near the cave, with his bow drawn, ready to
    shoot the bear, but his arrow did not wound the bear fatally and the
    bear seized him and crushed him to death. The enraged bear then turned
    upon the other Indians, but at last he sank to the ground riddled with
    arrows. They recovered the basket of dresses and returned home in a
    mournful procession, for one of their members had departed to the
    spirit land. The bear in his wild revelry had also lost his life.</p>

  <h3>THE WOOING OF ROBIN RED-BREAST.</h3>

  <p>Long centuries ago before the world was inhabited by very many
    people, Robin Red-breast lived as a handsome young man by himself in
    a magnificent mansion on the Klamath River. This skeptical young man
    always laughed mockingly at the suggestion of matrimony, as he was very
    rich and kept many servants about.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span> In fact he kept a servant for each
    room of his splendid mansion.</p>

  <p>He would often go by himself on moonlight strolls by the river or walk
    in the sunrise in early morning through the woods. The young maidens
    would catch a glimpse of him as he passed their windows, or as they
    peeked from out the bushes at him, admiring all the charms of his
    physical manhood. But proud young Red-breast would walk haughtily by
    them whenever he chanced to meet them and positively refused to accept
    any of their attentions that they were so eager to bestow upon him.
    Every maiden that chanced to catch a glimpse of him imagined herself in
    love with him, and her lonely heart would invariably yearn for his love
    that he might make her happy.</p>

  <p>The laws of olden times were very different from the laws of today. It
    was the rule then that when a young maid fell in love with a youth, it
    was her place to go and call on him first at his home, also to propose
    matrimony, unless the young man preferred to do so himself, then it
    was proper that he should. This was true in the case of Red-breast, as
    in the days of yore, when a young man returned a woman’s affections he
    would accept her love and make her his wife. And if he did not return
    her affections he would refuse to consider her proposal of marriage.</p>

  <p>Many young ladies called each day at Red-breast’s home, seeking the
    loving devotion that he might bestow upon them. He always kept a door
    usher to announce the arrival of any young lady that would call to seek
    his acquaintance, and desire to unite her fortune with his. The later
    was usually her purpose in view wishing a private interview. Red-breast
    gave strict orders to the usher not to admit any young lady that might
    call inside the door of his mansion, and besides he could never show
    her into his presence without consulting him first. When the usher
    would announce to Red-breast that a young lady was at the door wishing
    to interview him, Red-breast would always ask the kind and color of her
    dress, if the usher replied that she wore a suit of teach-ah-me-tah, he
    was told to send her away as he did not wish to see her.</p>

  <p>One by one the girls came to the mansion in hopes of securing an
    interview, but to their great disappointment they were all turned away
    from the door. One can imagine how many poor broken hearts followed
    each other as they had been dismissed from the door of love to go forth
    into the lonely world to weep.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span> Some of these girls were foolish enough
    to shut themselves in dark cells, that they might never be seen by the
    man who ruined their hopes of a happy wedded life. Other compassionate
    souls threw themselves into the sea, that their early sorrows and
    disappointments might be ended forever. Poor deluded girls, if they had
    only known how little Red-breast cared for their miseries and how he
    mocked them in his mansion they would never even have considered him as
    worthy of notice. However, many of the girls were not so foolish as to
    destroy all their future happiness but forgot the mocking Red-breast
    and sought other lovers whom they married and were very happy.</p>

  <p>It had now come to pass that all the girls in the world had called at
    the mansion of Red-breast for the purpose of wooing him for a husband,
    except one. All these girls had agreed among themselves that each take
    their turn in calling upon Red-breast until he selected one of them for
    his wife. Now all the girls in the world had called with exception of
    one, and all the other girls were restless and wondering what her fate
    would be. She was a sweet young thing with cheeks as red as cherries,
    eyes that sparkled like dew-drops and hair that hung in ringlets. It
    was an ideal Autumn morning when this maid called at Red-breast’s
    mansion, the madrone berries were ripe and hung in crimson clusters
    from the branches of the tree, filling the atmosphere with a dewy scent
    of sweetness. Heaven and earth seemed blending together and then fading
    away into the melancholy shadows of Autumn. Such was the appearance of
    the surrounding world when this shy sweet maiden came tripping lightly
    up the long wooded avenues to the door of Red-breast’s mansion with
    her heart all a flutter. The usher greeted her with a pleasant “good
    morning,” as her appearance was very stunning, and he bade her wait
    at the door until he returned with his message from his master. Upon
    announcing her arrival the haughty Red-breast said, “ah! I don’t care
    the snap of my fingers for the prettiest and sweetest maiden that ever
    walked the earth, it is not for her love and companionship that I care,
    but for what she might wear, her beautiful gown if it is made of the
    right material is all I want. I say again that they are all foolish
    young things to seek my love, for I have none to waste upon them, it
    is all concentrated upon myself and no one else.” Then he asked the
    usher the same question, as to what kind of a dress she wore. For the
    first time the usher replied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span> that she did not wear a dress of the
    teach-ah-me-tah like all the other girls had worn, but she wore a gown
    of pretty red, bedewed with clustering ornaments of its same gorgeous
    hues. My! exclaimed Red-breast, you can show her in at once, and he
    jumped to his feet in delight, his eyes sparkling with false pride. Go
    tell her quick that she is the only girl that ever had the honor to be
    admitted into my presence. Now I will woo her with all my heart and
    flatter her very soul away for the purpose, but not for my wife you
    know. You know what I am, so mind you don’t put her wise. Poor little
    girl, poor little foolish girl, it is a shame to treat her so cruel but
    I cannot help it when she wears such a tempting gown of red, red at
    last, my favorite color, and that color I am going to have.</p>

  <p>A minute later a sweet shy maid of scarce three seasons old was ushered
    into his halls and the magnificent apartments in which she stood before
    Red-breast. Her heart had ceased to beat for a few moments as he rose
    and greeted her in an elegant manner. He was far handsomer than she
    ever dreamed a man could be, and for the first time in her life she
    fancied that she was deeply in love. Breathlessly she recollected the
    stories of the other girls that had been before her, and now she could
    hardly blame them for their mad actions of self-destruction over such
    a striking personality. Red-breast received the maiden with a hearty
    welcome of flattery as he dismissed the usher from the apartment, that
    they might be alone to plan out the future. Gallantly he knelt at the
    fair maiden’s feet and poured out to her full measures of his love,
    in his elegant and commanding language he pictured in her mind how he
    had turned away so many other girls from his door who had come to seek
    him as their lover. How he had done because he could never love and
    knew that some day he would find his only true love which he believed
    to be her, as he had never felt the emotion of love until he first
    gazed into her bright eyes. His sweet voice sounded in her ears so
    soft and the touch of his fingers was as magical as Heaven itself. Her
    cheeks blushed redder than ever as she listened to his tender words of
    devotion. She shyly whispered, “yes” as he rose and pressed her against
    his breast, and they planned together for the marriage vows. They both
    agreed they would exchange the wedding vows on the following morning,
    then he held her by the hand and showed her into a nice room where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span> he
    said she could spend the night in peaceful dreams, and then he took
    his leave, leaving her alone in her room, and he told her that this
    room would always be her own private room, where she could retreat and
    find solace in being alone. Once alone she sat still for a long time,
    dreaming of the blissful future she would enjoy with a husband that so
    many had tried to woo but could never win because he loved her only.</p>

  <p>Night came with its shadows and she found herself very tired as her
    poor brain had been kept in a constant whirl since meeting Red-breast.
    Wearily she took off her beautiful gown and laid it carefully on a
    chair beside her bed and then hid her face under the silken covers.
    Soon in slumberland she did not waken until morning and the sun was
    already high in the sky. The gown she wore was the beautiful spangles
    of the madrone berries that blushed in their tint of the deepest
    vermillion red. While the maiden was sleeping Red-breast stole softly
    into the room and devoured the beautiful gown and all that night he
    feasted upon the berries and ornaments of the gown. As he gulped down
    the last berry he crept softly to the side of the sleeping beauty and
    gazed a farewell look upon her innocent face. He then changed his
    mansion into a dreary isle of Autumn dampness and flew away as a bird.
    Henceforth Red-breast never again appeared on earth as a man, but has
    ever since been on earth as a bird.</p>

  <p>Sad was the maiden that woke up that morning to find only a terrible
    disappointment awaiting her. She found in her heart no solace, but
    grief, bitter grief that had no compassion upon her bitter soul.
    Looking about her in her loneliness she saw that Red-breast had
    deceived her, and that he had selfishly eaten her pretty gown, all that
    she could find of it was the ugly strips that had held the ornaments
    in their place, and lo, this maiden so young and fair, and once so
    beautiful, fled down the damp aisles weeping for the chill of winter
    was upon her and had left her desolate, without her clothing.</p>

  <p>The moral of this story is that young women should have a care in
    pursuing handsome young men, lest they be deceived and left in
    desolation.</p>

  <h3>DR. BEAR AND MRS. SKUNK.</h3>

  <p>Once upon a time a father and mother skunk (wah-chelth) were rearing
    a family of two children and there was no food for them to eat. The
    old folks were in great distress about what to do as they were all
    starving. The mother was very anxious for her family, and one day
    she happened to think of a good plan to secure something to eat. So
    she announced to her family that she would play sick and have the
    bear (chee-ur-ra) come and doctor her. Her husband and children were
    delighted with her plan and Mrs. Skunk warned her children to keep very
    quiet when Mr. Bear came to doctor her, so she went to bed, feigning
    to be very ill while Mr. Skunk went after Dr. Bear and found him at
    home. The Doctor accompanied Mr. Skunk at once to the bedside of his
    wife and walking into the room began asking Mrs. Skunk about her
    illness and she replied in a very weak voice, pretending to feel very
    miserable and asked her children to go to one side of the room and be
    very quiet as she wanted Dr. Bear to examine her. The children went
    to one side of the room at once as they had been cautioned by their
    mother to keep very still, as she was going to throw musk in the Bear’s
    face and blind him. The Bear began to get things ready to doctor Mrs.
    Skunk and as he was about ready to examine her the children became very
    anxious and restless, and began whispering to each other and indulging
    in a big tete-a-tete, about what a large dinner they were going to
    have when their mother killed the Bear. They kept whispering so much
    that the Bear became suspicious of their actions and listened closely
    and his sharp ears caught a few words of their conversation about what
    their mother was going to do. He began moving towards the door to make
    his exit, when the mother Skunk saw that he was about ready to get
    away and threw the musk with all her might at the Bear’s face but it
    missed his eyes and he escaped safely. Mrs. Skunk became very angry
    with her children who had spoiled her plans, by being over anxious
    and whispering too much. Instead of getting the bear meat as they had
    anticipated, they both received a good sound thrashing from their
    mother which taught them a lesson for the future.</p>

  <h3>HOW THE ANIMALS CONQUERED THE MOON.</h3>

  <p>Many years ago there was a total eclipse of the moon which lasted for
    several days and nights. The night continued so dark that the people
    and animals were not able to see to go about, so all the animals of
    the animal kingdom held a council and decided to devour the moon, as
    it had become a useless planet and would not give them light at night.
    The animals journeyed from the earth up to the moon and began a fierce
    battle to conquer and devour it and after a long struggle the moon lost
    its balance in the heavens and fell earthward. It struck the earth
    at Ca-neck on the Klamath River where the waters whirl and rush into
    fearful rapids. At the lower terminations of these rapids where there
    is a large round depression in the land, on the south and west side
    of the river, is the place where the moon is supposed to have struck
    the earth when the animals threw it down from the heavens. While the
    animals and snakes were wrestling with the moon at Ca-neck it was then
    the frog stepped forth and objected, saying that they should not devour
    the moon completely, as they would need it to light the world at night
    in the future. Listening to the frog’s wise council they all agreed to
    allow him to restore the moon to its proper place. So the frog began
    at once to gather all the blood of the moon and fuse it together with
    its other remnants, and when he had completed the task all the reptiles
    and animals rendered their assistance in trying to throw the moon
    back into the heavens so it would shine again. The great multitude of
    animals became exhausted in their mighty efforts as they could not even
    move it from its resting place on earth. They were all so tired that
    they were about ready to give it up in despair, when the little ant
    (hah-pooth) came forward and suggested that he was able to do it. The
    multitude roared with laughter at the ant and taunted him with jeers,
    saying: “you little hah-pooth, what can a little insignificant thing
    like you do with the great big moon?” However, the little ant saw the
    opportunity to show his power of great strength, even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span> if he was little
    and rushed in among the crowd and made his way right under the moon,
    the moon began at once to raise from the earth, and with one mighty
    effort the little hah-pooth threw the moon back into the heavens where
    it has ever since remained.</p>

  <p>The Klamath Indians always remark when the moon is full, that the dark
    place on its face (known to the white man as the “man in the moon”) is
    the frog in the moon. Whenever there is an eclipse of the moon it is
    said that a huge frog is trying to swallow the moon.</p>

  <h3>THE ACORN.</h3>

  <p>Many years ago several families were out camping in the Fall, in the
    last part of October or November gathering acorns for food. (When the
    families get all fixed up in their acorn camps all go forth to pick the
    acorns each day as they drop from the tree, using the large baskets to
    put them in and carry to camp, in the evening when all have gathered
    at the camp house and the evening meal is over, all the family men,
    women and children take their places and commence taking the hulls off
    so as to get the meat or kernel out. This is done by the teeth and it
    is wonderful how expert we become at it, and it is seldom a kernel is
    mashed or bruised. These kernels are nearly always in halves, sometimes
    in three pieces and once in a great while there will be four pieces,
    and to find one that is divided into four pieces just as it grew in the
    shell is not a common occurrence. There is on the inside of the outer
    shell a very thin skin that covers the kernel or meat of the acorn.)
    There was a young Indian girl out with her basket picking acorns, and
    as she went along with her basket picking up acorns she would as often
    as she could, place some in her mouth and crack the hull and take the
    kernel out and put it in the basket with the ones that were not hulled.
    As she was going along she happened to open one where the kernel was
    in four parts which at once became very amusing to her, so she set her
    basket down and on taking a look at it she took the outer hull off
    and made a neat little cradle out of it, then she took the inner skin
    part and made a nice set of baby clothes, after she did this she took
    the whole of the kernel and covered with the clothes and placed it in
    the cradle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span> that she had made of the hull. After all was finished she
    looked at it and then put it in the hollow of an oak tree and went
    on picking her acorns until time to go back to the camp house. When
    it came time for them all to return to their homes she had forgotten
    what she had done. One day while she was preparing some acorn flour
    she heard a noise behind her, some one saying mother, mother, and on
    looking behind her she beheld a little boy and as soon as she saw him
    she knew that he was formed from the acorn that she had fixed and left
    in the hollow oak tree. She raised the Sa-quan or pestle in her hand
    and tried to catch the boy but he ran from her and she followed after
    him and the race kept up until the boy got to the edge of the ocean,
    where there was a man in a boat, so the boy jumped into the boat, the
    man pushed the boat off and together they started out to sea, and had
    got well out when the girl arrived at the sea-shore, she hurled the
    stone pestle at them and it fell into the sea and the top of it stuck
    up and is there to this day.</p>

  <p>Any Indian will tell his white brother this story as a true part to
    their religion, as calmly and seriously as if it was the truth and
    perhaps some of the lower class really believe it, yet it is only a
    fairy tale.</p>

  <p>This is the rock that sits out in the ocean some eight or ten miles
    from the land, at the present time from Orick or the mouth of Redwood
    Creek. This rock the white man calls Redding Rock, the Klamath Indians
    call it Sa-quan-ow. The true facts concerning this rock are told in a
    preceding chapter.</p>

  <h3>THE BLUE JAY.</h3>

  <p>There was an old mother deer making mush for her family’s breakfast
    one morning and while she was cooking it she broke her leg and she
    then allowed the marrow from the bone to run into the mush as she
    stirred it. This made the mush very palatable and oily. The Blue Jay
    who happened along at the time, watched the deer cooking the mush and
    saw her break her leg and mix the marrow fat with the mush and when the
    mush was cooked the Blue Jay tasted it and found it very delicious.
    That day when the Blue Jay went home she decided she would make her
    acorn mush in the same way, so after fixing her mush she broke her leg
    to get the marrow which she stirred into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span> mush, but to her great
    disappointment the substance she took from her leg was not oil but
    blood and when she saw how bloody it made her mush and which spoiled
    it, she became very mad for being so simple, so she at once turned upon
    herself and plucked out all her tail feather and stuck them in the top
    of her head and ever after the Blue Jay has worn a top-knot of feathers
    on the head.</p>

  <h3>THE MOURNFUL COO OF THE DOVE.</h3>

  <p>The Dove (Ah-row-wee) since the deluge of the world has been considered
    by the Klamath Indians as the sacred bird. They carry the symbol of the
    dove in their ceremonial worship in the sacred lodge, and worship the
    bird as divine. Around this little bird is woven a pathetic tale of why
    he coos so much and always seems so sorrowful.</p>

  <p>Long ago a family of doves made their home and nesting place on a
    level bench of land, about half a mile up from the Pec-wan village
    on the north-east side. On this bench-like piece of land on the hill
    side stood a very large live oak tree and close by the vicinity of
    this tree is a small spring of water which gushes forth, the rest of
    the flat being covered with grasses. In a little sheltered cove of
    this flat the Doves would make their nests and rear their families.
    When the baby doves grew strong and large enough to fly they would
    all fly up into the live oak tree. There they would hide among the
    branches when danger was near and all the families would roost among
    the branches of the trees every night. At this time there was a
    handsome young male Dove who announced his intentions of taking a trip
    up the river to Weitchpec, and while visiting among friends went with
    shiftless companions who taught him how to play Indian cards, which
    are made of small sticks and called pair-cauk, and the game wah-choo.
    The game became so fascinating that he spent the remainder of his
    time gambling and did not realize that he had left a sick grandmother
    at home and that she wished him to come back home at once. He was so
    deeply interested in the game that he did not take any heed of the
    message and continued to play cards. Later he received a message that
    his Grandmother was dead, but in the revelry of the game it seemed to
    him but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span> folly and played on, not heeding the words of the messenger
    who kept repeating the words that his grandmother was dead until he
    succeeded in diverting the attention of the youthful gambler. The
    young gambler looked up sadly from his cards and said, “I will now
    shuffle the cards again and again, yes, shuffle them again and again.
    My grandmother is dead, and to let the world know that I mourn her loss
    deeply, I will coo among the lonesome bushes the mournful coo of a
    broken heart, the piteous coo of a grief that knows no ending while I
    live.”</p>

  <p>The beautiful moral of this story is to teach and impress upon the
    minds of the children that they should not drift into shiftless ways,
    neglecting to respect and cherish their grandmothers and to love
    them as dearly as their own mothers and even more in respect to old
    age. Indian mothers repeat the story to their children and mourn as
    the doves, by repeating the words: Wee-poo-poo, wee-poo-poo-poo-poo,
    whee-whee-whee-poo-poo. Thus illustrating that they might become very
    sad and mournful by not being kind and thoughtful to the aged, and
    making their sunset years bright and cheerful.</p>

  <p>I could give enough of these Fairy Stories to make a book. All classes
    of my people, can on meeting his white brother sit down and tell him
    these Fairy tales, as a part of our religion, with a twinkle in his
    eye, and let him pass on. Some of our fairy stories are partly founded
    on truth and then carried off into an imaginary sense, so as to make
    them long.</p>

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If

without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
